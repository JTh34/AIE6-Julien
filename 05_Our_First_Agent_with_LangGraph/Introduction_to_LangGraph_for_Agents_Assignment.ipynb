    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

       "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's how it generally works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This step is crucial for grounding the generative model in factual and contextually relevant information.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input to a generative model. This can involve concatenating the retrieved text with the original input or using it to inform the model's understanding of the context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to produce a response or generate text. The goal is to create output that is not only coherent and contextually appropriate but also factually accurate and informative.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in applications like question answering, where the system needs to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers by leveraging both retrieval and generation capabilities.\""

However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/rambodazimi/KD-LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-07\\nTitle: A Note on LoRA\\nAuthors: Vlad Fomenko, Han Yu, Jongho Lee, Stanley Hsieh, Weizhu Chen\\nSummary: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy.\\nThis note extends the original LoRA paper by offering new perspectives that\\nwere not initially discussed and presents a series of insights for deploying\\nLoRA at scale. Without introducing new experiments, we aim to improve the\\nunderstanding and application of LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-18\\nTitle: LoRA-drop: Efficient LoRA Parameter Pruning based on Output Evaluation\\nAuthors: Hongyun Zhou, Xiangyu Lu, Wang Xu, Conghui Zhu, Tiejun Zhao, Muyun Yang\\nSummary: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is currently the most commonly used\\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, it introduces auxiliary\\nparameters for each layer to fine-tune the pre-trained model under limited\\ncomputing resources. However, it still faces resource consumption challenges\\nduring training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have\\ntackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA\\nparameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA\\nparameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size,\\nand gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate\\nthat a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values,\\nsubstantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we\\npropose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based\\non the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other\\nlayers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of\\ndifferent scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can\\nachieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining\\n50\\\\% of the LoRA parameters on average.\", name='arxiv', id='2c4538b1-12c3-4902-a923-1ee268be4b61', tool_call_id='call_CSTN2psRlEth9ywoZaej6Dln'), ToolMessage(content='[{\"url\": \"https://ai2050.schmidtsciences.org/fellow/tim-dettmers/\", \"content\": \"Tim Dettmers is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a Research Scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, and his research focuses on making\"}, {\"url\": \"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/author/tdettmers/\", \"content\": \"Tim Dettmers is a masters student in informatics at the University of Lugano where he works on deep learning research.

This survey\\nprovides an overview of the most important attention mechanisms proposed in the\\nliterature. The various attention mechanisms are explained by means of a\\nframework consisting of a general attention model, uniform notation, and a\\ncomprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the various\\nmeasures for evaluating attention models are reviewed, and methods to\\ncharacterize the structure of attention models based on the proposed framework\\nare discussed.

However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', id='de8bea33-7d6e-45e6-8154-d7623623affd', tool_call_id='call_XTssjDVZE0p3KcKGhDcpGPj2')]\n",

      "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively guide the behavior of AI models, particularly generative AI models like ChatGPT or DALL-E. It involves crafting instructions or queries in natural language to elicit specific responses from AI systems. This practice is crucial for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of AI-generated outputs. Prompt engineering can involve specifying a style, choice of words, grammar, providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic. It is a technique used by AI engineers to refine large language models (LLMs) with specific or recommended prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**History and Emergence of Prompt Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "Prompt engineering has its roots in the early days of natural language processing (NLP) and has evolved alongside the development of AI systems. The concept gained significant attention with the release of GPT-3 by OpenAI in 2020, which marked a milestone in the history of prompt engineering. GPT-3's ability to generate human-like text highlighted the potential of large-scale pretrained models and the importance of crafting effective prompts to guide these models' behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evolution of prompt engineering is closely tied to advancements in AI, such as the introduction of attention mechanisms in 2015 and reinforcement learning techniques in 2017. These developments improved the fluency and relevance of language model outputs, making prompt engineering a critical discipline for unlocking the full potential of AI models. The field has rapidly grown, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, which demonstrated the need for structured guidance to perform desired tasks effectively.\n",

      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances generative AI models by allowing them to retrieve and incorporate new information from external sources. This approach modifies interactions with large language models (LLMs) so that they can respond to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, supplementing information from their pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and updated information, which is particularly useful for knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of RAG first gained significant attention in the AI community after the publication of a 2020 paper titled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\" by Patrick Lewis and a team at Facebook AI Research. This paper highlighted the potential of RAG to significantly improve the value of generative AI systems by integrating newly available data at query time, rather than relying solely on pre-existing training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, the roots of RAG can be traced back to the early developments in information retrieval systems in the 1950s and 1960s. The technique evolved over the decades, with notable milestones such as the Ask Jeeves service in the mid-1990s and IBM's Watson in 2011, which showcased the potential of question-answering systems using natural language processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent advancements in RAG technology have focused on modular frameworks and the integration of advanced retrievers and LLMs, as well as the use of graph technology to improve the accuracy and contextual understanding of responses. These developments aim to address the limitations of existing RAG models and enhance their practical deployment in various applications, such as chatbots, email, and text messaging.\n",

This technique is part of transfer learning and involves making small adjustments to a pretrained model's parameters to improve its performance on a specific task. Fine-tuning often includes modifying or adding certain layers in the model while keeping most of the original structure intact. This approach allows the model to maintain its original capabilities while being tailored to new, specific tasks.\n",

      "**Prompt Engineering: Definition and Overview**\n",
      "\n",
      "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively guide the behavior of AI models, particularly generative AI models like ChatGPT or DALL-E. It involves crafting instructions or queries in natural language to elicit specific responses from AI models. This practice is crucial for improving the accuracy and effectiveness of AI-generated outputs. Prompt engineering can involve specifying a style, choice of words, grammar, providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic. It is a technique used by AI engineers to refine large language models (LLMs) with specific or recommended prompts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**History and Emergence of Prompt Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "Prompt engineering has its roots in the early days of natural language processing (NLP) and has evolved alongside the development of AI systems. The concept gained significant attention with the release of GPT-3 by OpenAI in 2020, which marked a milestone in the history of prompt engineering. GPT-3's ability to generate human-like text highlighted the potential of large-scale pretrained models and the importance of crafting effective prompts to guide the model's behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evolution of prompt engineering is closely tied to advancements in AI, such as the introduction of attention mechanisms in 2015 and reinforcement learning techniques in 2017. These developments have significantly improved the fluency, relevance, and contextual understanding of language model outputs. The rise of massive language models like GPT-3 transformed prompt engineering, allowing for greater adaptability and domain-specific tailoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, advanced prompting techniques, such as multimodal prompting, have further enhanced the versatility and interactive capabilities of language models, pushing them beyond conventional tasks. Prompt engineering has rapidly grown into its own discipline, reflecting the ongoing evolution of how we communicate with AI models.\n",

      "üìå PATTERN: RAG\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances generative AI models by allowing them to retrieve and incorporate new information from external sources. This approach modifies interactions with large language models (LLMs) so that they can respond to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, supplementing information from their pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information, which is particularly useful for knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of RAG first gained significant attention in the AI community after the publication of a 2020 paper titled \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\" by Patrick Lewis and a team at Facebook AI Research. This paper highlighted the potential of RAG to significantly improve the value of generative AI systems by integrating newly available data at query time, rather than relying solely on pre-existing training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, the roots of RAG can be traced back to the early 1970s with the development of question-answering systems that used natural language processing to access text. Over the years, the machine learning engines driving these systems have grown significantly, increasing their usefulness and popularity. Notable milestones in the evolution of RAG include the Ask Jeeves service in the mid-1990s and IBM's Watson in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent advancements in RAG technology include the development of modular frameworks and the integration of graph technology to improve the accuracy and contextual understanding of responses. These innovations aim to address the limitations of existing RAG models and enhance their practical deployment in various applications, such as chatbots, email, and text messaging.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fine-tuning in machine learning is a process where a pretrained model is further trained on a smaller, targeted dataset to adapt it for more specialized use cases. This technique is part of transfer learning and involves making small adjustments to a model's parameters to improve its performance on a specific task. Fine-tuning often includes modifying or adding certain layers in the model while keeping most of the original structure intact. This approach allows the model to maintain its original capabilities while being tailored to new, specific tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of fine-tuning has been around for some time, but it gained significant attention with the rise of deep learning and the availability of large pretrained models. The technique became particularly prominent with the development of models like BERT and GPT, which demonstrated the effectiveness of fine-tuning in natural language processing tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of historical context, fine-tuning has been a part of the broader machine learning landscape for several years, but its prominence has increased as models have become more complex and capable. The technique is now widely used in various applications, including reinforcement learning, where it helps improve policies by leveraging both offline and online data.\n",
