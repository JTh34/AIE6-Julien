# Offline Reinforcement Learning: Tutorial, Review, and Perspectives on Open Problems

### Overview
This post discusses a comprehensive review and tutorial on offline reinforcement learning (RL) as presented in the paper titled "Offline Reinforcement Learning: Tutorial, Review, and Perspectives on Open Problems" submitted to arXiv on **May 5, 2020**. 

### Key Findings
The paper serves as an extensive examination of offline reinforcement learning, highlighting its methodologies, challenges, and unresolved issues. Notably, offline RL can learn from pre-existing datasets without the need for further exploratory actions in the environment. This characteristic helps to alleviate the exploration difficulties found in traditional online learning approaches.

### Methodology
The authors categorize various offline RL approaches into distinct problem settings, including batch RL. They provide a synthesis of both theoretical insights and empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of diverse algorithms tailored for offline learning.

### Conclusion
The tutorial and review effectively lay the groundwork for understanding offline reinforcement learning, its potential applications, and future directions.
