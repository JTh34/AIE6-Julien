       "**Introduction**\n",
       "\n",
       "The OpenAI Agents SDK is a powerful tool for building agentic AI applications in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions. This introduction will provide an overview of the OpenAI Agents SDK, its features, benefits, and relevance to the field of artificial intelligence.\n",
       "\n",
       "The OpenAI Agents SDK enables developers to build complex relationships between tools and agents without a steep learning curve. The SDK's primitives include **Agents**, which are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools; **Handoffs**, which allow agents to delegate to other agents for specific tasks; and **Guardrails**, which enable the inputs to agents to be validated.\n",
       "\n",
       "The SDK has two driving design principles: providing enough features to be worth using, but few enough primitives to make it quick to learn; and working great out of the box, while allowing customization exactly what happens. The main features of the SDK include an **Agent loop** that handles calling tools, sending results to the LLM, and looping until the LLM is done; **Python-first** development that uses built-in language features to orchestrate and chain agents; **Handoffs** for coordinating and delegating between multiple agents; **Guardrails** for running input validations and checks in parallel to your agents; and **Tracing** that lets you visualize, debug, and monitor your workflows.\n",
       "\n",
       "The OpenAI Agents SDK is a production-ready upgrade of Swarm, the previous experimentation platform. It comes with built-in tracing that allows developers to visualize and debug their agentic flows, as well as evaluate them and fine-tune models for their application.\n",

       "\n",
       "OpenAI is a leading organization in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), with the mission to develop safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. As AI advances and becomes able to solve harder and harder problems, OpenAI aims to ensure that it benefits everyone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Founded in 2015 as a non-profit organization, OpenAI has made significant progress in developing large language models, text-to-image models, and text-to-video models. Its release of ChatGPT in November 2022 catalyzed widespread interest in generative AI. Additionally, the organization's public beta of \"OpenAI Gym\" in April 2016 provided a platform for reinforcement learning research.\n",
       "\n",
       "Throughout its history, OpenAI has developed various products and applications, including reinforcement learning platforms like RoboSumo, OpenAI Five, and Dactyl. The organization has also showcased impressive language generation capabilities with models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3. Furthermore, it has explored image classification with CLIP, text-to-image generation with DALL-E, and text-to-video generation with Sora.\n",
       "\n",
       "OpenAI's achievements have been marked by controversy, including the firing of its CEO Sam Altman, content moderation contract with Sama, and concerns over technological transparency. Despite these challenges, the organization remains committed to developing safe and beneficial AI that can benefit humanity.\n",

       "\n",
       "The OpenAI Agents SDK is a groundbreaking toolkit that enables developers to build intelligent AI applications capable of taking action independently. With its unique combination of large language models, tools, and coordination capabilities, this SDK represents the next evolution in AI development.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Defining Clear Data Structures**\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the key features of the OpenAI Agents SDK is its ability to define exactly what data structure you want your agent to return. By specifying an `output_type` parameter when creating an agent, you can produce exactly the data structures your application needs, making integration seamless and reducing code complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tools for Seamless Integration**\n",
       "\n",
       "The SDK supports three main types of tools: hosted tools (like WebSearchTool that run on OpenAI's servers), function tools (custom Python functions that extend agent capabilities), and agents-as-tools (using specialized agents as tools for other agents). This range of tool options enables developers to create highly customized AI applications that can be easily integrated with existing systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Benefits of Structured Outputs**\n",
       "\n",
       "Using the `output_type` parameter, you can ensure that your agents produce structured outputs using Pydantic models. This not only simplifies data integration but also provides a clear understanding of the output format, making it easier to debug and maintain your AI applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Handoffs: Delegating Between Agents**\n",
       "\n",
       "The OpenAI Agents SDK also enables developers to create handoffs between specialized agents, allowing for seamless delegation of tasks and data sharing. This feature is particularly useful when building complex AI systems that require coordination between multiple agents.\n",
