    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",

    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "The best way to write a loop in Python largely depends on the specific task you're trying to accomplish. However, I can share some general tips and common patterns that are considered best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Use a `for` loop for Iteration\n",
      "If you're iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), using a `for` loop is often best practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a for loop\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is not known\n",
      "A `while` loop is suitable when the condition needs to be evaluated before each iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a while loop\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Use `enumerate()` for Index and Value\n",
      "If you need both the index and the value in a `for` loop, use `enumerate()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Using enumerate\n",
      "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. List Comprehensions for Simple Loops\n",
      "When you need to create a new list by performing an operation on each item in an existing list, a list comprehension is often more readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a list comprehension\n",
      "squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "print(squared_numbers)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Avoid Modifying the List While Iterating\n",
      "It's generally not advisable to change the list you're iterating over, as it can lead to unexpected behavior. If you need to modify the list, consider iterating over a copy.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Avoid modifying the list directly while iterating\n",
      "original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
      "for item in original_list[:]:  # iterating over a copy\n",
      "    if item % 2 == 0:\n",
      "        original_list.remove(item)\n",
      "print(original_list)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Use `break` and `continue` Judiciously\n",
      "- `break` can be used to exit the loop early.\n",
      "- `continue` can skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for number in range(10):\n",
      "    if number == 5:\n",
      "        break  # exits the loop when number is 5\n",
      "    print(number)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. Be Mindful of Performance\n",
      "If you're dealing with large datasets, consider using optimized functions from libraries like NumPy or pandas instead of writing loops in pure Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these patterns has its place, so choosing the right one depends on the specific context of your problem. If you have a specific use case in mind, feel free to share it, and I can provide more tailored guidance!\n"

      "\n",

      "1) Understanding the question:\n",
      "The question is asking for a method or process to transform a desire into a concrete goal, specifically in the context of financial aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Analysis of available information:\n",
      "- **Excerpt #1** discusses the importance of putting your desire into a concrete form by writing it down and creating a plan for its realization.\n",
      "- **Excerpt #2** emphasizes the need to start visualizing possession of the money and being alert for plans that may come to mind, which should be acted upon immediately.\n",
      "- **Excerpt #3** outlines specific steps to create a definite plan, including writing a clear statement of the desired amount of money, the time limit for acquiring it, and what one intends to give in return.\n",
      "- **Excerpt #4** lists the first three steps in the process of transforming desire into financial equivalent, highlighting the need for definiteness in the amount desired and what one is willing to give in return.\n",

      "3) Extraction of relevant information:\n",
      "- From **Excerpt #1**, the key point is to reduce your desire to writing and create a plan for its realization.\n",
      "- **Excerpt #2** advises to visualize possession of the money and to act on inspirations that arise.\n",
      "- **Excerpt #3** provides a structured approach: fix the exact amount of money desired, determine what you will give in return, and establish a date for possession.\n",
