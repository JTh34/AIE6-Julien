Buying a puppy is almost as easy nowadays as ordering this book online. But the truth is, a puppy isn’t a product you can stick in a cupboard and forget about if you don’t like it. And they are deﬁnitely not something we should buy just because they’d look nice in our house…or because they’re popular right now…or because someone down the road has just got one…or you’ve seen one you like on TV.\n\nHave a word with yourself before you even start thinking about looking for a puppy. You have to be realistic about what you can bring to the table. You might think you’re going to get ﬁt by walking your dog every day— and this is true—but can you put your hand on your heart and say you’ll be able to give a dog the exercise it needs for the next ten, maybe even ﬁfteen, years? An under-exercised dog will undoubtedly make your life hell (you’ll make their life hell too).\n\nAnd what about training? Yes, this book will show you how to train your dog. But it’s not going to physically do it for you. That’s still your job, I’m afraid. Training is time-consuming and requires your total focus and attention, especially in the early days when your puppy is learning so much and taking everything in like a mad thing. Then you’ve got to ﬁnd the money to feed them, and vet bills can add up, especially if your dog’s breed has speciﬁc problems. And thing called BREED FULFILLMENT.",

As we know them today, dogs have come from a long line of ancestors who were bred for a speciﬁc purpose, from hunting and guarding to rescuing or just sitting on someone’s lap (that’s why they’re called lapdogs).\n\nWhatever your dog was originally bred to do is called its breed genetic disposition, the characteristics and instincts that have been bred into their physical and psychological proﬁles over centuries. Maybe your greyhound needs bursts of intense speed every day—that’s their genetic disposition to race—or your terrier needs to pull and “rag” on toys to emulate how they might pull a rat out of a hole.\n\nFulﬁlling these basic genetic urges through the kind of play, activities, and general lifestyle you give your puppy is called breed fulﬁllment. It’s about helping your dog behave in its most natural and instinctive way. And like all of us, dogs are happiest and at their best when their basic needs are being met. More on breed fulﬁllment as we go along, but here’s a GOLDEN RULE: Ask yourself if you can deliver what’s necessary to keep your dog stimulated and breed-fulﬁlled in the right way.\n\nAs well as breed fulﬁllment, there are a few other things I want you to think about and ask yourself or discuss with your family or partner—or basically anyone else who is going to be involved in the dog’s life.\n\nThese are especially important if this is your ﬁrst time owning a dog:",

Every dog has different exercise needs, both physical and mental. Be realistic about how much time you can give that dog daily. Do not be fooled into thinking small dogs need less exercise!

If you are dreaming of a blue-eyed husky, are you also prepared to vacuum the carpet ﬁve times a day? You will have fur in your dinner, bath, and cup of tea! It’s relentless. If you want a dog that doesn’t shed tons, look at something like a Labradoodle or other so-called hypoallergenic breeds (but remember, there is no such thing as a fully hypoallergenic dog; it’s all about their saliva and how much they slobber). Slobber! That’s right; everyone loves a St. Bernard until they have slobber dripping from their ceiling! You must take this into consideration—larger dogs tend to be more slobbery. If you’re the sort of person who keeps everything nice and tidy, this dog will not be your friend. Health. Breeding will play a part in this, but generally speaking, certain breeds have fewer ailments than others. Potential vet bills are deﬁnitely something to consider.

If you’re still unsure which breed is right for you, let me suggest a few that I think make brilliant ﬁrst dogs.\n\nEvery trainer and dog lover will tell you something different about what breeds are best for you. At the end of the day, it’s your choice. But these are my top ﬁve dogs for a ﬁrst-time owner. I’ve chosen them based on a decade’s experience of working with breeds of all sorts and seeing ﬁrsthand some of the common problems among dogs. These ﬁve are all typically easygoing, good-natured, smart, and willing to learn. The Rottweiler man in me can observe occasional “over-friendliness” in these breeds, but that’s not a bad thing for beginners, and basically makes them perfect for the novice trainer. If your heart is set on an American bully, but you’ve never had a dog before, think about having one of these dogs ﬁrst—you can always grow your family later on (but, PLEASE, never get a second dog until your ﬁrst one is properly trained!).\n\nThere’s a reason these dogs are favorite dogs for families—they’re calm and very affectionate (soppy). They are extremely intelligent and energetic, so they are easy to train and great for families who like the outdoors. They’re classed as medium-sized dogs, but some of them can get pretty big. Grooming requirements are fairly minimal (barring some heavy shedding), just a decent brush twice a week is all you really need, along with the occasional nail trim.",

They’ve got big, shaggy coats and, in my experience, slobber everywhere. But they’re also ﬁercely loyal, loving, and intelligent, making them an excellent choice for ﬁrst-time dog owners, especially families. They’re not small though, so make sure you’ve got the room. They will grow up to be very strong dogs, so training from the get-go is essential.\n\nAs with the Newfoundland, this is a big dog with a big heart, with the bonus of looking kind of like a lion (they were originally bred in Germany to look like lions!). Conﬁdent but not aggressive, friendly but not crazy, these are great ﬁrst-time dogs—but again, only for those with the space at home.\n\nLabradors are the nation’s favorite pet dog, and for good reason. They’re clever, kind, affectionate, and calm. It’s no coincidence they’re the breed used as guide dogs for the blind—they are just so smart and reliable. You can’t go wrong here.\n\nBorder terriers are small and short-haired, so they shed far less than dogs with longer coats. In my experience, they are a highly intelligent breed and generally very easy to train. They’re also exceptional with people and children and have bags of character. They were originally bred to hunt rodents, so they’re determined and brave—but getting socialization right is key to avoiding aggression toward other animals.\n\nAt the end of the day, whichever breed you choose, this book will help you.

I’m a big fan of mutts and my dog Roxy is a terrier crossbreed. The right crosses can make some of the best dogs and some combinations are now so popular that they are almost standalone breeds; I’m talking Lurchers (Border collie and greyhound), cockapoos (cocker spaniel and poodle), and the like. The downside when considering crossbreeds is that you can’t always know exactly what breeds or crossbreeds their parents were. This can sometimes\n\nmean you have more questions than answers regarding some of the fundamentals on my checklist. It can also make breed fulﬁllment especially difﬁcult. How will you fulﬁll the breed’s genetics when you don’t know what the breed is?\n\nDo not fear. There is a thing called dog fulﬁllment. This is about meeting the needs of the dog in front of you, not necessarily the breed. For example, we know that things like scent and sound drive all dogs; they like food, and they are—at their core—predatory animals. So even if we don’t know much incorporate our about a dog’s breed genetic disposition, we can understanding of their basic needs into our training to satisfy the dog. And, of course, we can observe and work with the dog in front of us. More on this soon.\n\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, you’ve thought long and hard about the right dog for you, your family, and your lifestyle. And you’ve been brutally honest with yourself about your ability to meet the needs of the breed you chose. (I sincerely hope you have, anyway.) The next step is to go out and get one. The ﬁrst question you’re going to ask yourself is this: Where the f*ck do I start?",

I’m talking about puppy farms and backyard breeders, people.\n\nThe lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 saw a huge rise in the number of people taking on new puppies. We all had more time at home and, for many of us, getting a dog was the apparent answer to all of our problems of loneliness\n\nand isolation. But here’s the thing people don’t think about—the enormous spike in demand for puppies was fueled by thousands of unscrupulous breeders who were literally pumping puppies out of their exhausted and maltreated dogs to get the maximum amount of cash they could for the minimum amount of effort. These people have no regard for the health or welfare of the puppies they bring into the world.\n\nIt was particularly problematic for the so-called fashionable breeds— dogs like your French bulldogs, American bullies, and cockapoos—who can come with some pretty hefty health problems, even in the best of hands. And due to backyard breeders—people with no breeding knowledge— playing God with these puppies, we saw a lot of dogs being born with severe health and behavioral problems.",

And those are the ofﬁcial numbers. There are also countless thousands of unwanted puppies who don’t ever make it to a rescue center.\n\nDemand for dogs also saw an increase in puppy imports and third-party sales; young dogs were transported overseas in large numbers in low- welfare conditions and then sold online by people posing as breeders. The number of licenses issued in the UK for the commercial import of dogs more than doubled in 2019–20, to over 12,000. That’s 12,000 people importing very young puppies in big containers, sometimes with up to 150 of them in there all at once. Long journeys like this in substandard conditions are not good for young puppies—many of whom have been poorly bred and may already have health problems—before going through an incredibly stressful and traumatic experience like that. More unhealthy puppies, more people spending stupid amounts of money on dogs that don’t stand a chance and fueling a wildly out-of-control breeding industry.

People discover their bitch is pregnant and can’t cope with the reality of having puppies, or they get one from a breeder and very quickly realize they have made a giant error. In theory, a decent breeder will want you to return an unwanted puppy to them (and its mom), but dodgy breeders won’t take puppies back, so they end up at the rescue centers. Rescuing a puppy isn’t for everyone. With a rescue puppy, you don’t always know what has happened to them before you come into their lives. You might not get to see their parents, or even know their parents’ breed.

A puppy runs over to them, jumps all over them, licks their face, and they decide that this puppy is their destiny—it’s love at ﬁrst sight! No! That’s just the biggest, most headstrong and willful puppy in the litter. And if that’s what they’re like at eight weeks old, imagine what they’re going to be like at eight months when they’re smashing their way through the dog park! Or, at the other end of the spectrum, people feel sorry for the so-called runt and decide it’s their job to help this puppy because they have a savior complex. But this puppy is more likely to be nervous and have anxiety problems later on. If you aren’t prepared to manage a dog who lacks conﬁdence and work with them to build it, you could ﬁnd yourself with a problem pup further down the line.\n\nIf you are a ﬁrst-time or inexperienced dog owner, ideally you want the one in the middle: the calm and affable puppy who is energetic, but not crazy, curious, but not anxious. At the end of the day, it all depends on you and the kind of dog you want. You might like crazy, in which case, ﬁll your boots! Which puppy you pick will be up to you and will be determined, to some extent, by which ones are available. But one thing you should try to avoid doing is bringing home two puppies from the same litter. And if you are dealing with a breeder who is happy to let you take two puppies from the same litter, you really need to question how competent this breeder is.",

    "page_content": "People think having siblings will be nice for the puppies, and they will play together and look after each other. Sorry, but no. As I have already mentioned, this is not a Disney ﬁlm. Just because two dogs come from the same litter doesn’t mean they will share some kind of magical sibling bond and enjoy each other’s company for the next 15 years. Quite the opposite, in fact. Littermates form a pecking order from very early on, and when you\n\nbring two of them home together, that stays with them and can grow and become enhanced. What this means, in reality, is that one of your dogs will always dominate the other, a situation that, if not carefully managed, can lead to all sorts of trouble.\n\nLittermate syndrome, aka sibling aggression, is very common when you take two pups from the same litter into the same household beyond the eight- to ten-week mark. Littermate syndrome isn’t exclusive to the litter either; two puppies of the same age from different litters can also still develop littermate syndrome. This syndrome is why puppies very often ﬁght with each other as they get older. They form a very close—and often codependent—bond with each other (anyone with their own sibling will probably relate to this!).\n\nFixing littermate syndrome means working with them individually, something puppies need, but it can be a massive chore as they panic whenever they are separated. For this very reason, a decent breeder will never sell you two dogs from the same litter. Although some people will tell you they have raised two puppies from the same litter and never experienced this, the truth is they have dodged a bullet. As a dog trainer of ten years, I’ve seen enough disastrous littermate relationships to know that they are the exception to the rule.",

This means that training will be well established with your ﬁrst dog and that strong sense of littermate rivalry will be dormant. At the same time, there will still be less than a year between them in age, so that they will have years ahead of them to run and play and have the time of their lives together.\n\nFor dogs, sex is very much a black-and-white situation. You have bitches (the girls) and you have dogs (the boys), and each sex has its own characteristics that are worth thinking about before you bring one home.\n\nWithout being too controversial, I actually prefer bitches. All my dogs are bitches—mainly because when you give them a belly rub, you don’t accidentally rub a penis. But also because, in my experience, females are more nurturing and loving and generally the kind of dog I like to have\n\naround the place. But, as with all species, when they kick off they really mean it! Males can be a bit gooﬁer and emotionally detached. When they kick off, it’s all bravado and “look at me, I’m Billy Big Bollocks.” To make things more complicated, your breed will also play a part in gender characteristics, so be sure to talk to your breeder or do some research about the breed you’ve chosen and how bitches and dogs can differ. You also need to remember that bitches have seasons during which they bleed and attract the attention of male dogs. And dogs like to mark their territory by p*ssing everywhere. When they pee, it’s up something, whereas with bitches, it’s usually on a ﬂat surface.",

They care about staying alive, food and protection, growing, using all their new skills, and satisfying their curiosity. Back in the\n\nlitter with their mom and all their littermates, there were plenty of opportunities for play and stimulation, endless food and warmth. So when I say make it a smooth transition, what I mean is make sure, as far as you can, that all of these things are in place at your puppy’s new home. Diamanté collars can wait.\n\nIn a second, I’m going to give you my breakdown of all the things you’ll need and why, but ﬁrst, I want to tell you the one thing you deﬁnitely don’t need to buy: PUPPY PADS. It doesn’t matter how you dress them up, how the theory works, or how worried you are about your carpets getting ruined —puppy pads send a message to your dog that it’s OK to p*ss and sh*t in your house. They encourage the EXACT OPPOSITE of the behavior you want your dog to learn. You are setting them up to fail, ladies and gentlemen; that is not what we are all about.\n\nWe’ll come to toilet training properly in chapter 4, but for now, just remember this: puppy pads tell your puppy it’s OK to sh*t and p*ss in your house. If you are OK with that, by all means, go out and buy a load of them. But if you want to teach your puppy to do their business outside, save yourself a load of hassle and cash and leave the puppy pads at the pet shop.",

But ask yourself this: Would you put your newborn baby to sleep on the ﬂoor in the middle of the room or on a chair? No, you wouldn’t. You’d put them somewhere safe, reassuring, and comfortable. That’s all a crate is, a\n\nreassuring space for your puppy where they can rest and you can be sure they’re OK.\n\nThink of it as a den-like environment, similar to the whelping box they will have spent their ﬁrst eight weeks in. They like it. We’ll come to how to use a crate and crate training in the next chapter, but for now just make sure you’ve got one—and if you live in a house with stairs, preferably two (one for upstairs and one for downstairs).\n\nYou can get all sorts of crates with plastic windows and curtains—that’s your choice at the end of the day. Just make sure you can open and close it easily and that your puppy can get in and out of the crate. A plastic base that you can easily clean will also be a bonus.\n\nPuppies frikkin’ love food, and they love to chew sh*t! We’ll be using food a lot over the next few weeks and months to build the bond between you and create motivation for your puppy. At Southend Dog Training, we’re all about feeding our dogs raw food—yes, RAW. Why? Because it’s a species-appropriate diet. It’s not full of crap and it’s great for their teeth and gums.",

You can get a full pen or use gates to section off an area of your home where your pup can move around freely; just make sure it’s safe and not full of dangerous chemicals or exposed wiring. You also need to be able to get in and out of the area easily, so don’t put high boundaries there that make it difﬁcult for you to move freely.\n\nWhen getting your puppy’s ID tag made, I’d suggest you put your name and address, your dog’s name, and your telephone number on it. Also check your local laws about dog ID tags. At this stage, a collar needs to be soft and easy to take on and off, with room for at least two ﬁngers between your puppy’s neck and the collar. We’ll come to getting them used to it in the next chapter; just make sure you have something at home ready for them to put on as soon as they arrive.\n\nThis is essential; it will go on your puppy’s collar every time they are out of the crate for the ﬁrst few months.

Hand-feeding your dog is the best and quickest way to build a bond between the two of you.\n\nWith every bit of food that passes from your hand to their mouth, you are strengthening the relationship between you and your dog. Not only that, but hand-feeding requires your dog to do something in return for their food. When you put their food in a bowl on the ﬂoor and walk away, you miss out on endless training and teaching opportunities. Your bowl-fed dog learns that its next meal is coming in a few hours, so the power of food as a motivator for training and good behavior is reduced.\n\nIf you’re hand-feeding your dog, you’re never really giving them “treats” or a “meal”—you’re just giving them their food slowly throughout the day.\n\nYou might be out on a walk, in the garden, or in the toilet—it doesn’t matter where you feed them or at what time. If you are hand-feeding them, it happens throughout the day. So try to let go of the idea of set mealtimes and matching bowls.\n\nBut how do you know how much to give them? It’s simple, guys. Work out your puppy’s daily allowance of food according to its weight. Your food supplier should provide this information. If you don’t have scales at home, you should be able to easily weigh your puppy at the vet—most vets have a scale in their waiting room.

The meat should be the very ﬁrst ingredient on the list: if it comes halfway down, after colorings and preservatives, it might as well just be dust. It should not be multicolored or shaped like something weird: the more messed around with their food is, the less natural it is.\n\nBeing a puppy is thirsty work. After a busy training session, ensure your pup has access to clean, fresh water. To help with toilet training, it’s best not to give them totally free access to water just yet. Like us, dogs need to stay hydrated to keep everything working. Some dogs are messier drinkers than others…keep a towel nearby.\n\nTIP: Water is a big indicator of how healthy they are. If your pup is drinking excessive\n\namounts of water, it could mean their food is not agreeing with them or they have an\n\nunderlying illness. Keep an eye on things, and if in doubt, talk to your vet.\n\nIt seems obvious, guys, but try to decide on a name before you bring them home, please!

You can’t get frustrated with your dog for not understanding or knowing what they are meant to do. You are teaching them. If they get something wrong or don’t seem to understand, that’s your fault and not theirs. Stay calm and patient and you will get there.\n\nRepetition is key in training dogs. You do stuff with them, and you repeat it until they get it. They like rules and knowing where they are with things, so you need to be consistent. You can’t decide they’re not allowed on the sofa and then change your mind one evening because you want a cuddle. And you have to be consistent with the positive stuff too. That means always rewarding them—with a treat, a belly rub, or whatever it is—when they do the right thing. We’ll go into more detail soon, but for now, just remember",

I’m here to talk you through the ﬁrst few days of living with your new puppy. Not to freak you out or anything, but this is a REALLY important moment and getting it right now will help you stay on track further down the line.\n\nThe smooth transition I mentioned in the last chapter is a key thing to remember. Your little puppy’s world has just been turned upside down. They will be relying on you to show them what to do now, so make sure you can give them loads of attention and generally be there for them in this transitional period. It’s no good getting a puppy in the morning and then going off to work for the day. If you can’t give them the time and focus they deserve right now, it isn’t the right time for you to get a dog.\n\nYou can do a few things for your puppy to make that all-important transition to their new home go as smoothly as possible. This list is a guide —you don’t need to rigidly do things in this order—but try to incorporate these key points into their ﬁrst day at home with you.\n\nWhen you bring your puppy through your front door, the ﬁrst thing I want you to do is to make sure it’s nice and quiet. Do not invite everyone you know over to meet your new puppy! All of that can wait. This is a baby animal experiencing major sensory overload. They’ve probably just been in a car for the ﬁrst time and they might have traveled a long distance. They don’t know what the frik is going on! Use your common sense here and give your puppy a calm and soothing ﬁrst day or so in their new home.",

Firstly, the world is a big toilet to them right now, and if left to their own devices, they can—and will—p*ss and sh*t everywhere. But secondly, too much space will terrify the little guy or girl. A major mistake people make is letting their puppy explore too much, too soon. Putting their leash on lets them know they should stay close to you for now. There is loads of time for discovering the rest of the house later on. For now, just take your puppy into the rooms it is going to be allowed in. For most of us, that usually means the kitchen and maybe the living room. Have your pen set up in one of these rooms as a space they can roam freely in, then introduce them to that and let them discover things at a nice gentle pace.\n\nTIP: Kids’ bedrooms and puppies do not go well together.

For example, you might travel a lot and need to leave your dog with other people for periods, or you might\n\nwork unpredictable hours. It makes sense that a dog locked into a regular routine will ﬁnd it stressful when things keep changing all the time. But for puppies, a daily routine is reassuring and helps them settle into their new surroundings.\n\nYoung dogs like to know where they are with things. It is also a massive win when it comes to toilet training. Putting that structure into their daily schedule means you’ll know when they eat, when they sleep, and when they’re likely to need to go to the toilet. Happy days! It’s also about helping this young animal adjust to life in the human world.\n\nYour life is busy, I know, so you need those windows of time when you know your puppy will be asleep or playing independently.

Attention is the foundation of all the behaviors you are trying to teach your dog here.\n\nIn a moment, we’ll learn about how to get that attention and the different ways you can reward and motivate your puppy to consistently pay attention to you. For now, I just want you to keep the Art of Attention in mind as you progress through each paragraph and notice how it comes into everything I teach.\n\nThis might sound self-explanatory, but it’s more complex and important than it sounds. We all need to switch off sometimes and puppies are no different. But because you are literally their whole world right now, it’s sometimes hard for puppies to feel secure enough to know that it’s OK to do nothing for a bit and that you will still be there when that rest time is over. Some dogs are naturals at switching off, and others need to be shown how to relax.\n\nYou will already have been practicing this by using their crate and putting them in there at the end of their training and play sessions. You will also have been teaching them the DOWN stay, and using your GOOD marker to increase the duration of that stay (this is explained later). But the Art of Doing Nothing (AODN) is more than telling your puppy to lie down; they need to understand that there are times when you want them to switch off and just chill out.",

There’s a whole FAQ section at the back of the book that touches on this and other commonly asked questions.) Wherever it is that your dog chills out, this is where they need to understand the Art of Doing Nothing.\n\nAnd it’s not just for at home. The AODN is a useful skill to have wherever you are with your puppy. For example, you might take your puppy for a walk with a friend and decide to stop by the local pub for lunch on the way home. Being able to reliably know that you can enjoy your\n\nlunch without your puppy running around in circles and causing havoc is a beautiful thing, people. Teaching your dog this is basic good manners for them and for all the people you encounter on your daily travels—be it in a pub, on a train station platform, or a doctor’s ofﬁce waiting room— wherever other people are just getting on with their business and don’t want to be terrorized by a crazy puppy!\n\nLike the Art of Attention, the Art of Doing Nothing isn’t a command you can train your dog to perform; it’s a life skill for your puppy, and a concept you can keep in mind as we go through this training section. Got all of that? Awesome! Let’s go.",

It’s also a sound they will hear over and over for the rest of their lives. And like any of us hearing something over and over, puppies can become kind of desensitized to their name and lose the joy of hearing it. Worse, if their name is something they only hear in association with trouble, they’ll start to fear and actively avoid the sound of it. This will make recall training very, very difﬁcult.\n\nWhen this happens, you begin to ﬁnd that dogs stop paying attention to you when you say their name. And if you’ve got a dog who isn’t interested when you say their name, you’ve got some serious training trouble on your hands, my friends. So my message here is to keep a positive tone in your voice when you say their name. Keep it light and fun. In a moment, we’re going to look at other ways you can get, keep, and reward their attention (Just Say Yes), but for now your job is simply to keep that name giving them happy thoughts and feelings when you say it. And if you’re not sure they’ve got it yet, go back over the technique we learned in chapter 4: Name. Reward. Name. Reward. Name. Reward, etc. Repeat until it sticks.\n\nWith a second dog in the house, it’s important you use their individual names so they know you’re talking to them. But once you’ve gotten their attention, you don’t need to say their name repeatedly. It becomes a nag— and no one likes a nagging Nelly!",

Never heard of marker training? Maybe you’ve heard of clickers? Some people like to use clickers, which are also markers, but I prefer to use spoken words. That way, I never ﬁnd myself out without the clicker, plus I think it reinforces the bond between the dog and me. They respond to a voice more than a click. Anyway, the point is, I’m a big proponent of marker training, and the reason for this is simple: the difference between marker-trained dogs and non-marker-trained dogs is like night and day. A marker-trained dog understands at all times what is being asked of them. They do the right thing, you feel happy, they feel happy, and everyone’s a winner.\n\nSo now I’ve sold it to you, you’re probably thinking, “OK, what is marker training then?” Don’t worry, you will not be drawing on your puppy with a Sharpie!\n\nMarkers are simply keywords that let your dog know they’ve done something good (like SIT) or they’re currently doing something good (for example, DOWN), and they’re going to get a reward. Markers help your dog understand what’s expected of them. They give your dog clarity. You will be saying a marker word after every command you give your dog to reinforce its meaning. There are three markers listed below.\n\nYES is basically about rewarding your dog for doing the right thing.",

But puppies are busy little bees and easily distracted, so you need to learn and practice the art of getting and keeping their attention, guys. Practice this exercise until you can reliably say your puppy knows that looking at you is what needs to happen before any reward comes their way.\n\nNOTE: YES is not a command or a request for them to do something; it’s a conﬁrmation that they have done what you wanted them to do, such as SIT or DOWN. I’m using SIT in this scenario because you have already taught your puppy to sit.\n\nGet your dog’s favorite food in your ﬁngers. Tell your dog to SIT—wait for them to sit. Wait for them to look at you (direct eye contact required). Step back and say YES as you give your dog a treat to reward them.\n\nNow that you’ve started introducing YES to your puppy’s vocabulary,\n\nthere are two other important marker words: GOOD and BREAK.\n\nThis is what’s called a duration marker. This means the dog is doing what you have asked them to do and you want them to continue doing it. Unlike YES, where your puppy comes to you for their reward and the behavior is over, with GOOD, you take the reward to them to encourage them to continue the good behavior, i.e., a duration sit.\n\nThis is a signal that the exercise is over.

I will talk you through these one by one in a second, but I just want to ﬂag that there is no linear approach here—you can practice any of these commands during any training session.

Dogs tend to respond best to strong, single-syllable commands (that’s why we say SIT to them, not “please be seated”). When your puppy has done\n\nsomething you’ve asked them to, you want to relay this in your tone of voice. This is when you can be high-pitched and happy in your tone.\n\nHowever, when your puppy is unsure, or if you are communicating that you would like them to do something, try to deliver your words in a tone that leaves no room for doubt. I’m not saying you need to shout at them, but remember that dogs communicate in barks. I’m not asking you to bark—but again, remember that barks come in short, single-syllable bursts. Use a ﬁrm, short manner that lets them know what’s being expected of them and you can get to the happy bit much quicker.\n\nHow you move and how your body occupies the space you and your dog share plays a massive part in how your puppy responds to you. On a simplistic level, asking your puppy to lie down but pointing up to the sky will send a confusing message to them. So try to always think about the signals you use when communicating with them. But more than this, body language is about your physical presence and what it represents to your pup. If you want your puppy to drop something or stop doing something, standing behind them, talking on the phone while you are waving at them, or generally making your presence smaller to them will probably not get your message across. Standing in front of them, ﬁrm and conﬁdent, so that they can see that you mean what you are saying lets them know this is a nonnegotiable request.",

Whereas, if you move forward and actually step into their space, you’ll ﬁnd that they stop jumping up at you. You have taken ownership of the space as opposed to giving it up by moving backward. Guys, let me be clear: heavy- handedness and physical aggression toward a puppy is NEVER OK. But you can use your body language to assert yourself and communicate with your puppy when you want them to do something.\n\nThis is probably the most basic command you will teach your pup, but it’s also one of the most useful, and all dogs should know it.\n\nYou need SIT because you want to be able to keep your puppy in one place at times, perhaps because you want them to calm down before they do something else, or because you need to know they’re in a safe place for a minute while you answer the door or whatever it is. SIT means they sit and should stay sitting until released or given further instructions. The stay is implied.

Many reactivity- based issues come about simply because your puppy has not learned how to behave on the leash when outside of your home. Proper leash walking teaches your puppy to be calm and to follow you (which will help with recall), and when done properly, it’s a great bonding experience.\n\nReactivity in a dog is a catchall term for when they react to certain simulations or stimuli. It’s not about aggression, although it can show up as this in some dogs if not handled correctly. Reactivity can look like barking, lunging, crouching down in a stalkerish kind of a position, whining, chewing—it can be anything that seems out of the ordinary. Your dog can be reactive to humans or other animals, or it can be reactive to certain environments or sounds—it all depends on the dog and their genetics, socialization experiences, and pretty much everything else.",

My training methods with puppies are all about preventing reactivity and avoiding those difﬁcult behaviors before they set in. Why? Because as I’m writing this, Leo (the massive Rottweiler who you see on the cover of this book) is chilling out at my feet, just doing his own thing while I work, not bothering me or feeling stressed about anything. He’s happy in his own skin and feels safe and secure. This hasn’t happened by magic; it’s because we have done everything that I am teaching you in this book. So keep reading!\n\nNow, with teaching a puppy leash walking, I don’t believe in being overly strict. I’m not looking for that militant-looking walk with the dog walking perfectly by my side, staring up at my face the whole time. The main focus at this stage should be on allowing the pup to explore and take in the world, to build their knowledge and conﬁdence. So my only real requirement with puppy leash walking is for them not to pull.\n\nWhen they get to the adolescent mark at around six months, you can start adding in a lot more structure, like having your puppy walk by your side at HEEL for ten minutes or so before allowing the dog time to sniff and explore as a reward—we’ll come to the HEEL command and adding structure later on in Adolescence on this page.)\n\nSo, guys, here’s the thing—the easiest way to stop your dog from pulling as you walk is to not reinforce pulling. By this I mean if you continue to move forward (walk) while they’re putting tension on the leash (pulling), your puppy will quickly learn that pulling creates a forward motion—and you are basically reinforcing pulling. So stop leash pulling with a puppy.",

But remember, what might take you an hour today will take you 50\n\nminutes tomorrow, then 45, and so forth until it becomes second nature to your puppy.\n\nFor the best results, practice leash walking inside the house at ﬁrst, ideally in a non-distracting environment like a hallway (not a room full of food or children). Try to ensure your puppy is calm when they see the leash (no jumping around or getting excited—that goes for you and the dog). Work on your puppy’s understanding of thresholds before leaving the house. If you have a very energetic dog, a quick play session with a ball or ﬂirt pole before the walk will get out some of their pent-up energy and make for an easier walk. Once your puppy has their vaccinations and you start going out with them, master walking up and down your street before taking them to a completely new and distracting environment (like a dog park).",

The average home is full of small items just waiting for a puppy to chew and choke on. Phone chargers, hairbrushes, shoes…you get the idea. And when you begin to get out and about, the potential for disaster only increases. Imagine being with your puppy and he picks up a cooked chicken bone but doesn’t understand what LEAVE IT means. Things could very quickly go south for your pup. Every single dog on the planet must understand what LEAVE IT means; there are no exceptions.\n\nTo teach LEAVE IT, I like to use things the dog can’t have, like a kid’s toy. Soft toys like small teddy bears are great because they also look like small animals, making them doubly desirable to your curious puppy. Begin with your puppy on the leash and let them know you’ve got the toy, then throw it a short distance, somewhere they can still see it. They will instantly\n\ntry to run over to investigate the ﬂying teddy. Use your leash to gently hold your puppy back and say the words LEAVE IT as you prevent them from getting to the toy. As soon as you feel the leash relax—meaning they have stopped trying to reach the toy—use the marker YES to let them know they have done the right thing, and they can come to you for a reward.\n\nRinse and repeat with many different items in different areas of the home, and for best results, practice this at random times so that your dog understands this command applies in all situations.",

It is extremely important, and for me as a trainer nonnegotiable, that you teach dogs how to respect thresholds. The rule here is plain and simple: an open door does NOT mean your puppy can automatically run through it. Thresholds are quite a complex concept for your puppy to grasp. We live in homes with rooms that have doorways and entrances where, most of the time, you don’t need to prevent them from moving freely through them (unless you especially want to). But front doors, back gates, crates, car doors/trunks, and any new environments that can pose a potential danger—or cause chaos on the other side—are a must-train. If you live near a road, failure to establish a clear understanding of thresholds could result in injury or even death of your beloved new puppy.\n\nMake sure your puppy is on their long training leash so that if they somehow make it past you,\n\nStand between your puppy and the threshold you are working on (a back door onto a garden is\n\nideal for this initial training as you don’t risk your puppy being distracted or tempted by trafﬁc\n\nor passersby).

Practice opening doors at random times without actually letting your dog pass\n\nGrooming is an essential part of training your puppy, and there are no exceptions. This is not about putting their hair in a bow or giving them ﬂuffy ankles; it’s about giving your puppy the basic care and maintenance they need. It’s also about helping them learn to be comfortable with being handled.\n\nDogs come in all shapes and sizes, so your puppy’s breed will play a big part in their grooming requirements. A Border terrier with a thick, wiry coat and oily follicles that can become blocked and irritated will need to be hand-stripped. This is where the groomer removes the dead hairs from their coat by hand instead of clippers. However, a breed with a shorter, smoother coat, like a Staffordshire bull terrier, will be ﬁne with just a quick brush when it comes to coat maintenance.\n\nGrooming is a real craft, and a decent dog groomer can make life a lot easier for you, especially with a dog whose coat needs a lot of maintenance. I recommend you ﬁnd yourself a good groomer as soon as you get your puppy (they can start being groomed as soon as they’ve had their second round of vaccinations, around ten to twelve weeks). Don’t forget to build those costs into the picture when you are weighing up the affordability of a dog, folks. This is an essential service, so you can’t skimp on it.

A good groomer is worth their weight in gold, but it will always help them do their job better if you can raise a desensitized puppy, by which I mean one that is completely chilled out about being handled. So, before your puppy goes to the groomer, they should ideally be happy to be handled all over, have their paws and tails held, their coats brushed, and used to having human hands in areas such as their mouth and ears.\n\nIt’s easy to introduce basic grooming to your pup from the get-go, and you should aim to set aside time for mini-grooming sessions, where you practice stroking, touching, holding, and brushing your puppy. If they’ve got ﬂoppy ears, you can gently lift them, as well as lifting their top lip to get them used to the idea that, sometimes, you want to look at their teeth. Do all of this in very short sessions with lots and lots of rewards and praise— again, this is always made easier if you are hand-feeding your dog. But not to worry if you aren’t hand-feeding; high-quality training treats will help do the job!\n\nGrooming is also a great opportunity to check for any abnormal lumps and bumps, which if found you should let your vet know about immediately.

Dogs just don’t need shampoo, guys!\n\nA decent, balanced diet will ensure your puppy’s coat looks great. If they get covered in mud, and you really need to clean them up, a simple wash with lukewarm water and a good brush is all they need.\n\nAs with their coats, puppies’ claws are pretty self-regulating, and for most of them, daily exposure to pavements, patios, and other hard surfaces is enough to keep them in check (my Rottweiler, Daisy, was a senior before we ever had to trim her claws). However, sometimes their claws can get a bit long and make life difﬁcult for you when handling them as they can scratch.\n\nLong, uncomfortable claws can also affect their foot placement and the way they walk, and occasionally a dew claw (the big toe/thumb claw located farther up the limb) can be loosely attached, so it’s always worth keeping an eye on your puppy’s claws and dealing with any problems swiftly. You can buy claw trimmers for dogs, but I recommend you let your groomer do this if needed. A wrong clip can lead to bleeding and a traumatic experience for your pup.

For now, I want you to focus on making all of these ﬁrst experiences feel positive and motivating for your pup.\n\nYour puppy’s ﬁrst walks out in the world will be a sensory overload. All the new sights, sounds, smells, and sensations are likely overwhelming, so take it slow! You will already have been practicing leash walking in the house, and your puppy should be accustomed to the leash being on. An ideal ﬁrst walk would be to simply continue the leash walking you’ve already been doing by walking up and down your road or around the grounds of your apartment.\n\nIf your pup stops, let them stop. If your pup wants to sniff, let them sniff. If you feel like your pup is scared or panicking (they might be shaking or physically cowering or whimpering), try to let them go through the motions and ﬁnd their conﬁdence.

Once you become a dog owner, you notice that dogs are EVERYWHERE. And if you are at the park or in an area where people walk their dogs a lot, you will encounter many adult dogs who are not on leashes. For many puppies, the sight of an adult dog bounding over to them at high speed can be terrifying and lead to long-term fear of other dogs. As your puppy’s only source of protection and conﬁdence, you need to prevent this from happening.\n\nI hear it over and over, “It’s OK, they’re friendly!” People let their off-leash dog come running over to yours, and it starts snifﬁng around or humping your dog and jumping all over them. When people shout this to me as their dog invades my dog’s space, I always know that what they are really saying is that they can’t control their dog. Someone shouting “It’s OK, they’re friendly!” from across the park is shouting this because their dog has no recall—their dog is basically not trained, and their dog’s face up your puppy’s butt is risky business.\n\nAs soon as you see an adult dog bounding over to your puppy, I want you to put your puppy behind you and form a protective shield between your\n\npuppy and the other dog.

It massively reduces the risk of them having a bad experience.\n\nHere’s an example: the owner of an off-leash dog has asked if their dog can come over and say hello to your puppy. You have agreed, but it’s the ﬁrst time your puppy has met such a big dog and you’re not sure what will happen. They start snifﬁng each other. Count in your head for three seconds: 1, 2, 3. Call your puppy back to you and use your leash as a lure if they don’t come back at ﬁrst. Mark and reward them for returning to you, even while a new dog distracted them. If they seemed to like the other dog, there is nothing to stop you from reintroducing them in a few minutes.\n\nKeeping it short and sweet with the three-second rule ensures that none of the dogs become overstimulated, and you don’t end up with two wildly hyper dogs bowling over each other. It also teaches your young puppy the importance of impulse control and the need to respond to you (the art of attention, guys!) even when distracted by a big, exciting new friend. And it ensures that you remain your puppy’s favorite thing.

Never heard of a puppy fear imprint period? It is really important that you know about these! A fear imprint period is something that happens to a puppy, usually between eight to eleven weeks old, and just around the time you are bringing them home. It can happen twice in some dogs— usually, the second time comes around six months. During these imprint periods, your dog can become spooked by the strangest things. My Rottweiler, Daisy, got really freaked out by statues and overﬂowing garbage cans, while a Patterdale terrier I know was terriﬁed of gates. They can become irrationally scared of all sorts of stuff, but the important thing to remember is that the thing that is freaking them out isn’t the issue. What matters is your response to it.\n\nWe can screw dogs up in these important periods of their lives by making a big deal of whatever it is they are scared of, avoiding certain situations, or mollycoddling the dog and pulling them close when they get scared. Your efforts to reassure a dog who is scared of a kid’s bike by pulling them back and telling them it’s OK might make sense to you, but to the dog it only ampliﬁes their sense of caution and fear. They learn to be afraid of the bike and continue to bark and growl at every kid on a bike they see, forevermore. Not ideal.\n\nRemember: I would be out of a job if telling a dog “It’s OK” was enough.",

She went on to become one of the most conﬁdent dogs I’ve ever known.\n\nGOLDEN RULE: If your puppy is acting scared of something, do not try to “comfort” them in the way you might a human being. Instead, lead by\n\nexample and show them they have nothing to fear. Slow down and take deep breaths. It’s a phase—don’t overthink it.\n\nSocialization is about teaching your dog how to be comfortable and content in the real world, be it around humans, other dogs, noises, smells, or any other distractions they may encounter. Proper socialization is incredibly important, as a dog who doesn’t feel conﬁdent and relaxed around new people and experiences can become fearful and reactive, and this leads to all sorts of problems that you really don’t need in your life.",

A lot of people think socializing a puppy means they just need to take their dog out a lot and let it meet loads of people and other dogs, and that will be ﬁne. But contrary to this belief, letting your puppy meet everything and everyone it comes across is not what socialization is about. Socialization is something that needs to be approached seriously as a key part of your puppy’s training schedule. For that reason, I like to break it down into three key areas that can easily be worked through. These are: environmental, animal, and human. Let’s have a closer look.\n\nEnvironmental doesn’t only mean taking your pup out to plenty of different places and spaces—although this is massively important. It’s also about letting them experience different kinds of weather, temperatures, and terrains—so, yes, that means you’ve got to get your gear on and get outside even when it’s pouring!\n\nOne of the big mistakes I regularly see people make with their dogs is to only take them to the same place every day. How boring is that! It is not only unfulﬁlling for you and the dog, but it is also not helping your dog learn how to be cool in new situations. Sure, you might think you’ve got a dog who is well-behaved in the ﬁeld you take them to every day. But if that ﬁeld of grass is the only place they ever go to outside of their home, your dog is going to totally lose their sh*t if you take them to a new park or ﬁeld one day.

And that, my friends, is when things start to go wrong.\n\nProper environmental exposure is about taking your dog to many different places and letting them see, feel, and experience as many different sights, sounds, and smells as possible. It’s about getting out in the rain, snow, wind, and sunshine, walking through muddy ﬁelds and busy town centers, along open beaches, and through thick, dense woods. It’s also about pubs, shops, buses, and just about anywhere else you can think of that you’ll be taking your puppy, no matter how frequently or infrequently.\n\nWe’ve all seen, and probably laughed at, dogs who are afraid to walk through puddles and across certain surfaces, or dogs who are terriﬁed of loud bangs or heavy trafﬁc. Whatever it is they’re scared of, it’s because they were never exposed to these things (socialized) at a young age. You are building their conﬁdence and character by taking your dog to all these new places and allowing them to take in the world through their nose at their own pace. And remember, socialization is something you can do at the same time as all the obedience training that you learned in chapter 5. The more you can practice your SIT, DOWN, COME, and LEAVE IT commands in new and different places, the more able to function in any situation your dog will be.\n\nTake a look at the checklist on this page and simply work your way\n\nthrough it by taking your puppy for walks to all of the places mentioned.",

In the nicest sense, in this situation, I really just want you to shut the f*ck up! When your puppy freaks out, people tend to try to humanize them and reassure them, but this only worsens things. You need to stop for a second, shorten your puppy’s leash, take a deep breath, wait for the dog to stop panicking, and then move on. This way, the fear doesn’t win and your puppy’s ability to handle strange and stressful situations grows.\n\nCity dogs and country dogs—a few things to consider\n\nYour puppy’s breed and characteristics often stem from the environment they were originally bred to work and thrive in. Terriers and collies are dogs who worked the land, Labradors were bred for assistance, and lapdogs for\n\nlooking nice on someone’s lap. If you live in a busy city and ﬁnd yourself in possession of a big St. Bernard—a dog originally bred for Alpine rescues— it’s a good idea to make sure they are given at least some opportunities to fulﬁll their breed’s instincts and experience the environments they are designed to thrive in. With a St. Bernard, you might make hilly walks a priority, and with a terrier, let them access some outdoor terrain where they can really put their speed and determination to good use. Equally, a small dog with little legs and a lack of stamina, like a miniature dachshund or a Chihuahua, is not going to love long muddy walks in the country, so walks along nice even pavements where they can get into their stride are going to be more enjoyable for them.",

There are a lot of animals about! Especially if you live somewhere rural where animals like horses, cows, and sheep are a regular part of daily life. But even in the most urban setting, there are a surprising number of animals in our everyday lives, from other domestic pets like cats and hamsters, to the birds we see in the park, as well as the foxes who come into our gardens at night. So it’s not enough to just take your dog to the park and let them play with every dog they come across, thinking that you are somehow socializing them.\n\nIn fact, allowing your puppy to go up to every dog you meet and play with every dog whose path you cross is the opposite of what we want to achieve here. Letting them be “free range” might sound cool, but that is actually how many reactivity issues are formed.

You get a dog for you and your family. If you let your dog expect to be able to play with every other dog you meet, you’re not going to be spending that much time with them when you’re out and about, and their sense of loyalty to you will become diluted. Through establishing social ignorance, other dogs become less interesting to your puppy. Your pup becomes calm in the presence of other dogs. Social ignorance also applies to other animals you might encounter, like horses and sheep. Once you feel that your pup is suitably ignorant (I know, it sounds weird!), you can start introducing them to the dogs and other animals YOU want them to meet.\n\nIf a dog comes tearing across the ﬁeld with its owner screaming, “It’s OK, they’re friendly!,” from half a mile away, be very cautious. They are saying this because they know their COME command isn’t going to work. If that’s not in place, how do you know what will happen when your puppy meets their out-of-control dog?

What is that about?! Not only is it massively dull for your puppy, folks, but it can also cause reactivity. They learn to become comfortable in this one setting or routine, but as soon as you take them somewhere new, they revert to “factory settings” and struggle to pay attention to you because of the sensory overload of a new place. Mix up your walking routines with different places and ensure you are ticking off all the places on the environmental socialization checklist—and add a few more of your own if you can.\n\nYou can miss is uncomfortable and/or that your puppy overstimulated when someone else is making a fuss over them.

If they are reacting to another dog somehow and you stroke them because you think it will calm them down, you are effectively rewarding their unwanted behavior.

The fact is that dogs do not understand the nuances of the English language the way we do, folks. So when you say “It’s OK” to your puppy who is cowering in fear at the giant poodle who’s trying to hump them, you are basically talking nonsense to your dog and increasing their confusion and worry at the same time. If you think your puppy needs your protection or reassurance, show them with your body language (ﬁrm, conﬁdent pose) and by using words you know they understand. These should be your commands and your marker words. Everything else is irrelevant to them.\n\nYou’re going to have both; that’s a given. You are not building a robot dog, guys.

Thousands of people brought puppies into their lives while they were furloughed or working from home, only to ﬁnd they had to leave them at home alone for hours on end once things got back to normal. Puppies don’t understand the concept of jobs or popping out for a while, and they struggle to remember that even though you go away sometimes, you do come back. Separation anxiety can appear in many different ways. It can be more severe for some dogs than others, but either way, a pup experiencing this is a distressed animal who can whine, cry, defecate, destroy, and chew anything in its path when in the throes of an anxiety attack.",

You will have taught them the Art of Doing Nothing—the idea that you expect and endorse them switching off occasionally means they can “engage” AODN when they ﬁnd themselves home alone.\n\nHowever, as I said, no one gets this sh*t perfect every time, not even me. So if you ﬁnd your puppy is crying a lot when you go out, maybe they’re having toilet accidents and chewing sh*t up, or worse, the neighbors are complaining about them barking while you’re out, here are a couple of things you can do to halt this anxiety taking hold for the long term.\n\nIf you are still carrying around any ideas about crates being “prisons” or somehow cruel for your dog, now is the time to lose those misconceptions once and for all. Dogs like to take shelter in nest-like environments—you see this behavior in street dogs in countries where dogs aren’t so domesticated. Instead of shelters, we have crates in our homes, which can be a reassuring, safe space for your dog.\n\nYou will have been using a crate from day one of your training with me, but if for any reason it has slipped and you notice you’re not using the crate as much as you were, double down on your crate training.

(Remember, this is a measure for if and when your puppy has separation anxiety. I’m not saying everyone should automatically ration their affection, but if leaving them is becoming a problem, it could be that your puppy is overly dependent on being stroked and petted every time they are in your personal space.) It is perfectly OK to ignore your dog sometimes when they are around you and keep affection on your terms. Make a fuss about them as a reward for good behavior, not an automatic reﬂex because they’re cute. This way, your puppy learns physical connection doesn’t always happen every time you’re next to them or nearby; they become more able to self- soothe.\n\nToys that are mentally enriching for your puppy, such as KONGs and LickiMats, can be a real help with separation anxiety. Giving them something to do while you are away that is engaging and distracting means their focus moves away from you (or the lack of you) and to the task at hand. Put some of your puppy’s daily food allowance into a KONG, and suddenly your leaving becomes associated with food and dinnertime. A negative has become a positive!",

Dogs are very black- and-white in the way they think. They don’t realize you’re stressing about leaving them, and they don’t have the capacity for this kind of empathy. They just know that you left all stressed, which freaks them out more. So when you have to leave your dog, leave without emotion or hesitation and act as if nothing is happening.\n\nWith all of these measures in place, you should quite quickly see a reduction in any separation anxiety your puppy is experiencing. You might ﬁnd over time that you can ease your foot off the pedal with some of these strategies. I never crate my dogs when I go out these days due to separation anxiety. However, I always crate one of my dogs, Sammie, when I leave due to living next door to the Ministry of Defense, where lots of bangs go off randomly. Loud bangs tend to stress Sammie out when nobody is around, but when she is in her crate, she feels safe and secure and sleeps. I know that if they suffered separation anxiety, these are the tools I would bring into play to help ease the worry and stress they are experiencing.",

It’s different for every puppy and will depend largely on their breed and size, but generally speaking, you’re going to start experiencing a new type of terror somewhere around ﬁve to six months!\n\nNow, I don’t want to scare you—please be reassured that if you have been putting all your training into practice, this challenging period of your puppy’s development will be a little bit easier.\n\nYes, just like humans, canines experience a period of adolescence during which they lose their babyish cuteness and begin to morph into the adult dog you’ll be spending the next ten to ﬁfteen years with. Every dog goes through it, no exceptions, although some experience it more intensely than others. During your puppy’s adolescence, you’ll see them start to push their own boundaries (and your buttons) as their conﬁdence grows and they begin to explore the world around them and use their growing body, super senses, incredible strength, and coordination.\n\nWhile it’s often a very exciting period for a puppy, it’s less thrilling for owners, who can feel like they have lost their puppy during this time and begin to wonder what has happened to all the training they have been working hard on. Adolescent puppies can be impulsive and bold and often\n\nseem to forget all of the obedience commands and other good behaviors that they have been taught.",

For this reason, it’s not, as you might expect, the January after Christmas that people take their puppies to rescue centers, but later in the year, when their puppy hits six months old. This is often the time that people decide they can’t keep their dogs because they feel they cannot cope with the willful and deﬁant creature who is now living in their house.\n\nThe good news is that adolescence doesn’t last forever, usually between six months and a year. And if you can get some of the most difﬁcult behaviors in check, it can also be a fascinating period, as you begin to see your dog’s true personality emerge. So, if you are reading this while also pulling all your hair out and wondering how the hell you are going to cope with the adolescent puppy that is terrorizing your home, do not fear. This next bit is going to help you.\n\nAdolescence is when you will see your dog’s true personality arrive, and you will start to see all of their breed-speciﬁc traits begin to kick in. If you’ve got a spaniel, maybe you’ll start to notice them beginning to enjoy games of fetch. If you’ve got a sighthound, perhaps you’ll begin to see their incredible speed start to build up on walks, terriers will enjoy ragging with tug toys, and so on.",

If you don’t, that’s when things start to go wrong. The ﬁrst and most important thing you can do with your adolescent puppy is understand their breed requirements and ensure they are being met. A greyhound who doesn’t get to run is going to ﬂip out. A collie whose incredible brainpower is under- stimulated will make your life hell. Revisit your breed knowledge and ensure you are doing everything possible to meet your puppy’s innate needs.\n\nIt’s also important at this time to make sure you are reinforcing positive messaging with your puppy. It is very tempting to shout and generally lose your sh*t with a dog who has just eaten your new sofa, but that’s not going\n\nto get you or your puppy anywhere. They’ll just hear anger and noise and you’ll be stressed. It’s a pointless exercise all around, folks.\n\nWhen dealing with a boisterous and disobedient adolescent, the best thing you can do is take your training back to basics. Why? Because you want your dog to feel good about themselves, like they are doing something right, because doing the right thing gets them the treats and the fuss. Even though you might think you’ve got SIT sorted out and you’re really bored with going over the same old commands repeatedly, I want you to do exactly that. Revisit your basic commands and use your marker words, do anything that is an easy win for your dog and an easy win for you. SIT, reward. SIT, reward. When you are in the midst of a tricky adolescent period, this is the best way to reassure yourself and your puppy that you have got this. Your puppy will calm down, and your mental health will be restored.",

    "page_content": "I am revisiting leash walking in detail right now because it is the key to having a well-behaved dog. Ensuring you have decent leash work during this adolescent period will help reduce so many unwanted behaviors. It helps you maintain your hard-won pecking order in the sense that your dog is following you daily, going where you go, stopping when you stop, and generally taking all their cues from you.\n\nTo be clear, leash walking is pretty much the most common problem I see with my clients, regardless of the type or size of dog they are walking. Once we successfully address leash walking, many other issues quickly disappear. Remember, guys, when you are walking your dog, you’re also building a relationship. Even though you might think you’re off to pick up the kids from nursery school, in your dog’s mind, you are off on an adventure together…and you are the expedition leader!\n\nRemember: Your dog hasn’t forgotten everything you taught them, even if they behave like they have! Patience is key during adolescence, so be prepared to go over things and repeat things. It is worth doing this even if it does feel like everything is taking twice as long.\n\nDanger: Do not let your puppy off the leash too soon. I’ve touched on this on this page, but I just want to say it again, folks: Do not let your puppy run free off the leash before they are ready. This is a massively common\n\nmistake that can—and does—end in tragedy. Many people are lured into a false sense of security because of how well their puppy behaves during puppyhood. You should not even contemplate removing the leash while out in the park until they are at least 18 months old, once you have survived puppyhood and adolescence.",

If you feel you need to revisit some of the basics, go back to this page and double down on your leash walking practice. Even if you are now comfortably going for longer walks in different environments (socialization), you can still go back to basics, walking your puppy up and down your road or street just to reinforce everything they have learned so far.\n\nAs well as not massively pulling on the leash, your puppy should have a basic understanding of where the heel position is, even if you haven’t actually been using the word. This is because you have been luring them to your side to reward them with a treat every time they stop pulling. So, in theory, your puppy already knows how to come to HEEL; you just haven’t told them the name of this move yet!\n\nNow, in adolescence, is a good time to start adding in that structure and direction of the HEEL command because it helps you stay in control and reminds your puppy that you’re the source of all the good things in life.\n\nAdolescence is a time for going over your basics, but it’s also a time when you can start to introduce a few new, handy training tools to help with your puppy’s development. Before I go into anything in detail, I just want to be clear: it is vitally important to remember that, whatever training tool you choose to implement, you must understand how to ﬁt it correctly, how to teach your dog what it means, and how to use it safely. Without the proper use of these things, they can be detrimental and damaging to your pup’s training.",

I’m a big fan of Haltis, as they make a massive difference with dogs who continue to have pulling problems, especially reactive dogs who can pull unexpectedly. A Halti is a gentle head harness that controls the dog by the snout and takes all the pressure off the throat.\n\nTo introduce a Halti, you must ﬁrst make sure your puppy is comfortable putting their nose into the Halti. Do this by simply slipping it on and off and rewarding your puppy heavily for this (YES, and a treat). You’ll then need to get your puppy comfortable with having the Halti done up, so again, go heavy on the rewards and praise. Then you need to master walking your puppy with a Halti on in a low-distraction environment (i.e., your garden or somewhere else familiar, without loads of other dogs and people). Once your dog is comfortable moving around your garden, you can move to outside; get your dog comfortable in your street before moving on to high- distraction-level areas, such as parks. A decent structured walk should be ten minutes, with your dog nicely walking by your side, followed by ﬁve minutes where you allow your puppy to sniff and explore a little, before returning to a more structured HEEL walk.\n\nTIP: Haltis can be tricky to put on at ﬁrst, so watch a few online videos or ask a friend\n\nto demonstrate theirs just to get a feel for how they work.

This will only traumatize your puppy and may even make them afraid to go to the toilet in your presence…yes, even in your garden if you are present. This method is outdated and archaic. Your puppy will need to go to the toilet when they ﬁrst wake up and before they go back down for a nap. Look for the signs. Your dog’s nose glued to the ﬂoor,\n\nmoving back and forth erratically, could be a sign that your dog needs to go for a pee.\n\nPuppies are very much like toddlers; they will get into everything in a heartbeat. The leash helps you maintain control, remove your dog from situations in a nonconfrontational manner, and will make your life easier.\n\nThere is no set age for this; every dog is different. The general rule is when you do not need to use it anymore—because the dog is listening to your voice commands, behaving in the house, and knows how to switch off.\n\nWhat should I do if my puppy is chewing their leash?\n\nI ﬁnd that the quickest way to stop leash chewing is this: when it is in the puppy’s mouth, very ﬁrmly give a sharp tug on the leash.

Puppies will literally pick up anything that is new and out of the ordinary, or easily accessible, so in the beginning stages of training, don’t leave tempting things lying around that your pup can easily get. Remember, puppies sample the world with their mouths. When a puppy is awake, this is the time you should be interacting with the puppy and training. If you can’t because you are occupied elsewhere, they should be in a puppy pen with something to keep them occupied, like a KONG or brain puzzle.\n\nWhat is the difference between a puppy pen and a crate, and why do I need both?\n\nA crate is basically your dog’s bedroom; it’s where they go to sleep and learn to switch off—it becomes their safe space, a den-like environment. Your pup should go into their crate after regular training sessions to help achieve this, and the crate door must always be shut once you place them in the crate. A puppy pen is a place you can safely leave your puppy when you are busy and have not had time to get that energy out of the puppy—like a child’s playpen. It’s a secure enclosure that you put the pup in with their favorite toys to keep them occupied.\n\nWhat do I do if my puppy cries when I leave the room?\n\nIf you have just put them down for a nap in their crate, then don’t panic; it’s completely normal. However, if the puppy is full of beans and has already had a nap, you can use your puppy pen and give them a little chew to keep them occupied as, sometimes, we have to leave the room. This creates a positive association with you leaving and coming back. This will also reduce the chances of them crying when you leave the room.",

The problem with this approach is two-fold. Firstly, aggression may well escalate, and secondly, an either-or choice between forcible dominance or submission is not the only choice available to wolves, to dogs or to humans.\n\nWith what she calls “calming signals” based on canine expressive behavior, Turid Rugaas introduces dog trainers and owners to another option to try to improve relationships between humans and their dogs and between dogs and other dogs.

Realizing that English was not her native tongue, and wondering if she would understand, it took me until the end of the day to gather the nerve to approach her. Since that meeting back in 1992, I have spent a lot of time with Turid. I’ve invited her to present at my behavior and training camps and seminars both in the United States and overseas. She has captivated her audiences wherever she goes. She was a big hit in Japan with her blue eyes and ﬂaxen braids!\n\nTurid’s farm, Hagan Hundeskole, is located on a heavily forested mountain top overlooking scenic ﬁords of Norway. People from all over the country bring their dogs for her instruction in basic manners and rehabilitation of problem behaviors. I have been there to observe during her work with dogs and she has amazed me. The stories she tells in this book are true. I have come to realize that she is on the cutting edge of understanding canine behavior. The following quote from Turid gives the essence of her theory on calming-signals.",

    "page_content": "“Dogs, being ﬂock animals, have a language for communication with each other. Canine language in general consists of a large variety of signals using body, face, ears, tail, sounds, movement, and expression. The dog’s innate ability to signal is easily lost or reinforced through life’s experience. If we study the signals dogs use with each other and use them ourselves, we increase our ability to communicate with our dogs. Most noteworthy of all canine signals are the calming signals, which are used to maintain a healthy social hierarchy and resolution of conﬂict within the ﬂock. These are skills which, when carried over to our own interactions with dogs, can be highly beneﬁcial to our relationship. Dogs have the ability to calm themselves in the face of a shock (fearful or stressful situation) and to calm each other as well. As an example let’s consider the manner in which dogs meet each other. Dogs which are worried in a social situation can communicate concepts such as, ‘I know you are the boss around here and I won't make trouble.’ Furthermore, the boss dog is very apt to want the worried dog to realize that no trouble is intended. ‘Don’t worry, I’m in charge around here and I mean you no harm.’ Dogs that do not signal properly can be the cause of problems.”\n\nOn trips to Europe I make it a point to visit Turid’s farm, Hagan Hundeskole, to observe her work. I have been on seminar tours with her in Europe, USA and Japan. Whether a training camp north of the Arctic Circle or national symposium in Geneva, each time she has left me favorably impressed with her ability to explain to her audience what is going on with dog at any given time.

    "page_content": "In books about wolves you will ﬁnd the body language of wolves described as “cut-off” signals, as the observers saw how they were cutting off aggression in other wolves. These signals have been described for years and are well known. The same people describing these signals seem to think that dogs do not have the same ability to cut off aggression in each other ( Behavior of Wolves, Dogs and Related Canids by Michael Fox) – and how wrong they are! Dogs have the same ability and the same social skills to avoid conﬂicts as wolves have. Perhaps those observers did not see them, because the wolves are much more intense in their behavior due to their life situation. Dogs, that is domesticated dogs, are much more subtle in their skills and use much smaller letters, so to say. They are usually not in the same position of danger as wolves, and they do not have the same need to speak to each other in such big letters.\n\nWhen I started to observe and use these signals, I called them calming signals. Cut-off is not the appropriate word, as they are used much more as prevention than really cutting off behavior. The signals are used at an early stage to prevent things from happening, avoiding threats from people and dogs, calming down nervousness, fear, noise and unpleasant things. The signals are used for calming themselves when they feel stressed or uneasy. They are used to make the others involved feel safer and understand the goodwill the signals indicate. They are also used to enable dogs to make friends with other dogs and people.",

Wolves and dogs try to avoid conﬂicts. They are conﬂict-solving animals. It is usually we, the human species, who tend to create conﬂicts between our dogs and ourselves.\n\nWe will look more closely at these signals throughout this book, what they are and how they are used, in order to help you learn to understand your dog better and be a better \"parent\" for your dog. It will help you in training and handling, and I am certain that these new skills will enrich your life as they have mine.\n\nThink about an average day with your dog. You get up in the morning, with the \"Monday morning\" feeling, and tell the dog off with a bit of annoyance in your voice. He turns his face sideways to you, and licks his nose in one quick movement. You wash, ﬁnish getting ready and go to the door. The dog is happy to know that he is going out and fawns around you. You command him “SIT”! The commanding tone makes your dog yawn before he sits down. You put on his leash, go out of the door and he pulls a little.\n\nYou jerk him back, he then turns his back on you and puts his nose to the ground.\n\nAt the park you let him loose for a few minutes, and before long your wrist watch tells you that it is time to go back. You call your dog. Was your voice a little stressed? Your dog starts moving towards you slowly and in a curve. You think he does it to annoy you, and you yell at him. He sniffs the ground, curves even more, and looks away from you. He ﬁnally comes and you scold him or, even worse, you shake him. He turns his face from you, licking his nose or yawning.",

These signals are there as soon as anything happens.\n\nDogs use the signals as soon as there is anything to calm down. If they are awake, they “talk,” just like you and I.\n\nOften the signals come in quick movements, so quick that we need to really look hard to be able to see them. With practice at observation and experience you learn to see these small ﬂashes. Other dogs see them, even other animals, like cats. All it takes is a little practice and knowing what to look for.\n\nWolves have them. Dogs have inherited them. All of the various breeds all over the world have them, no matter what size, color, or shape they are. They all have them. It is a truly universal language and a wonderful one because it means we can communicate with dogs wherever we meet them.\n\nJust imagine being able to travel the world, and everywhere you go you can speak your native tongue, and everybody else understands because they all speak the same language. How marvellous that would be. I have been to the USA, Japan, England and many other countries, and I have seen it with my own eyes. Dogs speak the same language all over the world.\n\nSome breeds or types of dog have certain signals that are better developed than others due to their different appearance. Black dogs, for instance, have a tendency to use licking more than other facial expressions, although they understand dogs using other signals and they understand humans who use them.",

Whatever we choose will have consequences for our relationship with the dog. When you are using threats to your dog, intentionally or unintentionally, the dog will use calming signals in order to try to calm you. For the conﬂict-solving dog, threats must be calmed down. I prefer to put it this way: Why on earth should we ever use threatening signals to dogs?\n\nWhat signals are we talking about? We know at least 30 signals. Some signals are used for other things as well, in other situations. Some are so swift that we can hardly see them. It takes experience to see everything in every situation. But with experience and frequent observation, you will be able to catch a glimpse of them all, and you will always be able to tell how your dog is feeling. You will understand your dog much better. And isn’t that what we would all like? To really understand how they feel?\n\n“The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.”\n\nA signal can be a swift movement, with the dog either turning his head to the side and back, or holding his head to one side for some time. It can be just a tiny movement, or the whole head can be clearly and deliberately turned to the side for several seconds.",

Perhaps the other dog approached yours too quickly, or approached him directly head on instead of in a curve.\n\nHave you ever noticed your dog turning his head when you try to take a photo of him? He’s telling you that he feels uncomfortable with this.\n\nYour dog may turn his head if you stoop over him. Although he may stand still, he might also turn his head which tells you that he is feeling uncomfortable in this situation.\n\nYou can use head turning yourself when a dog starts to get worried or frightened if you have approached him impolitely. If a scared dog starts to bark or growl at you, stop moving towards him, turn your head to one side and this will help\n\nHow polite! Each of these dogs uses a calming signals in order to avoid conﬂict.\n\nFor example, when two dogs meet, they usually both look away for a second, and then they greet each other happily. Often, when I go up to my dog Saga to take her picture, she ﬁnds the camera a bit scary. She looks away when I take the picture, but looks at me again when I remove the camera from my face.\n\nWhen one dog turns his head another will often answer by doing the same.\n\n\"Shortening the eye\" by making the eyes look at another individual in a softer way, lowering the lids, and not staring in a threatening way, are signals. Your dog may use them when he looks at someone straight on but does not want to make himself seem threatening.\n\nA non-confrontational approach: “shortening the eye” indicates peaceful intentions.",

If you get the feeling that he actually feels threatened by it, you can stand up and look at him from above; this means that your eyes will become “shortened” and you will immediately seem to stare less. Many dogs ﬁnd it difﬁcult to have direct facial contact.\n\nTurning the side or back to someone is very calming. When dogs play together rather wildly, some of them will start turning their side or back to the others in between playing, to make things calm down a little.\n\nDespite the dog on the right giving off calming signals, the dog on the left still feels threatened. He turns away to increase the distance and lessen the threat.\n\nYour dog may use this signal when another dog growls or behaves threateningly towards him in some way, such as running up to him too quickly. He may also use it if you speak in a very cross voice or go up to\n\nhim when he feels that you are angry. When young dogs pester older ones, the older often turns back to make them calm down. When you jerk at the leash your dog may turn away from you, maybe pulling even more.\n\nYou can use this signal yourself when a dog shows signs of nervousness or aggression towards you. If he jumps up at you, turn away, and more often than not he will stop.\n\nIn the photo below, Julias has turned his head, then his side and ﬁnally his back to a very angry German Shepherd.

Ulla noticed that they were becoming overwhelmed, so she went to the middle of the ﬁeld and lay down, sphinx-like. One by one the others noticed her clear signal. In a matter of minutes, they had calmed down and also lay down around her.\n\nA scared little dog didn’t dare to approach Saga, who went into a down when she saw its fear. Gaining conﬁdence due to this clear show of empathy, it only took a very short while for the scared dog to pluck up enough courage to make contact.\n\nAn adult dog was together with ﬁve puppies that were harassing him, obviously thinking he was a recycled toy! At ﬁrst he was patient with them, but when they started to get too much he lay down. The puppies immediately responded, leaving him alone and playing with each other instead. When he got up, he was fair game, and they were at him once again.\n\nYawning is probably the most intriguing of the calming signals and is one which people seem to enjoy using.",

Playing with her might end with her biting at my trouser legs. When she starts to get excited, I stand still and yawn a little, and she relaxes.\n\nMy colleague Ståle came to my house when I was dealing with a client with a fearful dog. As Ståle came through the door he immediately noticed the dog’s fear and responded to it by standing still and yawning several times. The dog was interested in him, then turned to me, and I yawned too. In a matter of minutes the dog was quite comfortable with us and made contact with him.\n\nCandy was restless and stressed one evening so her owner sat down, yawning frequently. Candy eventually stopped her restless wandering, laid down by the owner's feet, and relaxed.\n\nLittle Sheila was loved very much by her owner. Once when I was there the owner picked Sheila up, put her on her lap and hugged her. Dogs feel uncomfortable in such a tight situation, so Sheila yawned and yawned.\n\nAbove: Tia uses the yawn frequently.

Alternatively a dog may persistently stand with his nose down to the ﬂoor for some time until the problem situation is over. As dogs also sniff to explore smells, it is important to look at the whole situation to be sure what it is.\n\nYour dog may sniff when another dog is approaching him, when someone is walking straight at him, or when a sudden situation occurs such as when another dog suddenly appears too close to him. When you walk along the\n\nroad and someone is walking directly at you, maybe carrying a big hat or something, your dog may sniff. When you call your dog and your voice shows annoyance or is rather authoritative, or maybe when you are standing facing full on to the dog, he may be likely to sniff several times while coming.\n\nSnifﬁng is one of those signals that are difﬁcult for people to use. I ﬁnd it hard to practice snifﬁng. But something similar can be used: you might try sitting down, pretending to scratch the grass or to examine something on the ﬂoor.\n\nThe Springer Spaniel turns sideways to Tia and sniffs giving a clear signal of a peaceful intention.\n\nOne signal is answered by another (snifﬁng and turning away).",

Mature dogs do not usually go straight toward each other.

It is frequently used when something is approaching or is in the dog’s way but where he still needs to go in that direction. When you walk with your dog by your side or in heel position and something comes towards him on that side, he might try to walk on the other side of you. If a dog looks fearful or angry, your dog will often use a wide curve around the dog in order to calm him down.\n\nYou can use this signal when approaching a fearful or aggressive dog or when you meet a dog that gives you a calming signal like snifﬁng, licking, head turning or something else. Sometimes you need to use a wide curve, or sometimes it is enough to change direction a tiny bit, just curving slightly past the dog.

If two dogs become a little tense or if they are too close to each other, a third party, dog or human, may use this signal.\n\nYou can position yourself to split up dogs when they get tense, when your dog becomes uneasy or frightened in a situation, or when children are playing or doing things to dogs that make the dogs feel uneasy.\n\nIn a puppy class some larger puppies started to be a little bit too rough with one of the smaller ones.

Cora was afraid of him every time she saw him, and her way of greeting him showed fear and also that she was desperately trying to calm him down.\n\nThe signals discussed so far are the most commonly used signals in dogs.

I immediately started to move towards Saga in order to get between them, but it became clear that I could stop and simply let things happen. Saga had already done her job. When they came rushing towards her, she turned her back on them and sat down.\n\nSaga’s action immediately took the energy out of the strange dogs. They slowed down, stopped barking and started to sniff the ground. They actually never went all the way up to Saga. They stopped at a distance and stood still, quietly snifﬁng the ground.\n\nSaga did not bother to make contact with them. Because they were behaving so badly to her, it took away any interest of friendship.\n\nSaga turns her back on a Setter to encourage a calmer approach.\n\nThe Tibetan Mastiff was brought to me by his new owner. In a normal voice the man asked the dog to sit, but at the same time he bent over him. The dog immediately shut down as his contact with reality became distorted, retreating from this world to an inner world where no harm could reach him.\n\nThese gentle giants with the deep and growling voices are so misunderstood, and someone had done something to make this dog afraid of being alive, unable to cope with the real world.\n\nThe dog sat there, completely lost, and the owner tried to pull at him. I asked him to let it be. I went over and sat down beside the dog, looking in the same direction as he was, gently stroking his chest with very slow movements, all the while yawning and breathing deeply.",

You have always the choice of being threatening or calming. To me the choice is easy.\n\nIs your dog being “stubborn” or “distracted” or just walking away snifﬁng as a result of your actions? It might be that the dog is feeling a little insecure, not coping or perhaps unsure of how to deal with the situation. Be patient and give him time. Or you can help him by taking him out of this situation or by being less demanding and he will soon feel more comfortable.\n\nThe dog on the far left is ﬁnding the whole situation too demanding. She moves away and turns her back.\n\nStress hormones are necessary for us. We need some quantity of them to be able to work, to have enough energy to do things we have to or want to do.

You become upset or angry, you feel shaky or thirsty, or you want to go to the toilet. All kinds of reactions will tell you that your adrenalin level is high.\n\nWe humans become stressed in the face of accidents, anger, violence, and other things that provoke excitement; but ﬁrst and foremost we get stressed in situations where we do not feel we can cope. Something is threatening us, and we are not sure about our ability to manage.\n\nDogs get stressed for the same reasons. They become stressed in situations of threat, of pain or of discomfort. They become stressed when we are angry or punish them. Excitement stresses them, such as when male dogs scent bitches in season. Lots of full speed action might stress a dog. But primarily a dog gets stressed for the same reason as humans: when they feel unable to cope.\n\nWhen dogs start to get stressed, they can show it in many ways. When they are stressed by the environment, you will usually see that they start using calming signals to try to ease the stress. So knowing the calming signals will also help us to see when a dog starts to feel stressed.\n\nScientiﬁc research has given us more information about stress. In Scandinavia studies have been done of parachutists, pilots, divers and others who frequently deal with situations of danger.\n\nA dog with a constantly high stress level will be much more likely to get stomach problems, allergies and heart trouble. They will be faster and more violent in their defense. They will probably have an activated defense mechanism at a much earlier point than others.",

However, there is a high probability that this is a simple reaction to a life that makes him stressed. His owner’s anger and demands make him unable to cope with daily life. He gets stressed. Together with the stress, it is also extremely likely that there will be a much higher level of self-defense, which is all too often the problem the owner comes to me with.\n\nVery often these dogs suffer from illnesses such as stomach problems or allergies or show problem behaviors like fear, aggression or barking.\n\nDogs learn by association. When, every time he sees another dog, he is being jerked on lead to make him heel or stop barking at the other dog, he will associate other dogs with a painful neck or back. Each time he sees another dog he will become stressed more and more quickly, and, in addition his defense mechanisms, will become much more rapidly activated by the heightened stress. A dog under this kind of pressure is also likely to behave aggressively toward other dogs, often to both males and females.\n\nThis leads up to my conclusion: There is no, absolutely no , reason or excuse to punish, be violent, threatening, or forceful towards a dog or to demand too much of him.\n\nAll of these things will make a dog stressed. In time, the stress will make him ill. He will become reactive more quickly, showing aggression to dogs or people, because he has a higher defense mechanism. It may end by him biting someone.",

The stress activates defense, which makes the dog more fearful. Where do we start to break up this bad circle?\n\nOne of the best ways to reduce stress is to be able to communicate with dogs. When you can make yourself understood by dogs, it is a wonderful feeling - for people and dogs alike. Calming signals are the key and seeing through that opened door has been like looking into a childhood dream of talking to the animals.\n\nThese dogs in a sit-stay in an obedience situation are ﬁnding it stressful. Each looks away from the other dogs, doing his best to calm himself and the others despite knowing that he is expected to stay in this position.\n\nYou can also begin to help your dog by stopping all force, punishment, aggression and anger towards him. Stop being threatening and start using calming signals. Your dog will understand and answer you back, and he will feel a lot better if you are friendly.\n\nBoth dogs turn their heads away from the child staring directly at them.\n\n5 Using Signals in Practical Handling and Training\n\nWhen you are training the dog to lie down or sit, do not bend over him. Bend your knees or stand upright. You might turn your side to the dog especially if he doesn’t like the exercise. Bending over will make the dog move slower, or he may try to avoid doing it completely.",

Stand upright, maybe with your side to the dog and then it is much more likely that he will come right up to you.\n\nDo not jerk or use a tight leash when commanding your dog to heel. It hurts, it is painful to the neck, and makes the dog try to turn away from you, snifﬁng the ground or giving off other calming signals. Keep the leash loose – make a smacking sound with your tongue when you want the dog’s attention, turn away from him in a right hand circle and the dog will follow if he is not dragged along or jerked at. A smacking sound, some praise and a\n\nturn to the right - that is all it takes, and it is much more pleasant than getting a sore neck.\n\nSitting close and putting your arm over the dog’s back will often make him feel uncomfortable as this dog shows by yawning.\n\nIf you have a dog that is a little worried by another dog, walking parallel with human barriers in between will make him feel more comfortable.\n\nOver time the distance between dogs can be narrowed.\n\nEventually the human barriers can drop out one at a time until the dogs are walking parallel with conﬁdence.\n\nCurving away from another dog will also help both feel more comfortable as this is their natural language.\n\nIf one dog is approaching another head on, someone \"splitting up\" by going in between them will help the dogs.\n\nThis is a question I often get. Dogs can’t lose their language completely because the language is a part of their genetic heritage, and they are born with it. However, they can suppress their signals if they get punished for using them, or have ever been attacked when they used them.",

    "page_content": "I have had experiences training dogs that seem to have no language at all. A young dog or a very stressed dog will often not use calming signals in a stressful situation. The reason for this is that often, when stress arises, the brain doesn’t function logically. It is possible to help a dog like this by making the situation easier to cope with, by creating enough distance between the dog and what it percieves as threatening, letting the dog face fewer threats, or allowing the dog to have the time to watch what is going on. Then the signals will return.\n\nBy simply allowing the dog to have more distance, he will be able to cope better and will feel more relaxed. Even better is to walk parallel to what he is worried about: using a barrier can also be a good idea, a barrier made of people if he is worried about dogs, or dogs if he is worried about people, for example.\n\nAnother thing to do is teach ourselves and our dogs to walk on a loose leash so that they get no pull or jerk on the leash, as mentioned in the previous chapter. The slightest discomfort when looking at another dog will ensure he has a negative association with that dog.\n\nAs we have seen, dogs learn by direct association, and so we must always be careful what signals we give to the dog when he looks at another dog, a person or a child. If we want him to form positive associations, to have positive feelings about anything, we must only give positive signals. In that way we can change a dog’s association with absolutely anything and anybody.",

She did a lot of rescue work and always had an amazing number of dogs in her house, many of them pregnant and thrown out by someone. They had their puppies in her house, so she had a lot of opportunities to observe newborn litters.\n\nThis colleague observed litters during a two year period from the day they were born until they left 9-10 weeks later, and I received the results of her observations.\n\nIt was obvious that newborn puppies could not use many calming signals, as they have very little control of their bodies at that time, and often the only signal they could give was yawning. They yawned particularly when they were picked up and handled, and they did that from the very ﬁrst day. One puppy was no more than seven hours old when he gave his ﬁrst calming signals.\n\nAll of the puppies yawned 100 percent of the times they were picked up, from day one. Since then we have observed litters born in the safety of their own home with no stress of being moved or thrown out, and in these cases the calming signals would come days later.\n\nThe signals increase as the puppy grows older and have more control of their bodies, and when puppies turn up in my puppy classes they seem to master them all, or understand them all.",

They become problem dogs, because they have problems.\n\nA safe, secure, patient and friendly puppy-hood and adolescence will give the dog the very best basis for growing up to be a harmonious, well- functioning adult dog.\n\nRemember that wolves bringing up wolf cubs get perfect wolves out of them, and dogs bringing up puppies get perfect dogs out of them. When we humans bring up puppies, we get problems.\n\nIt is about time we looked at leadership as a myth we do not need. We need to be parents, good parents, the way dogs are good parents.",

Only then will we really gain their trust, allowing a relationship to develop based on mutual respect.\n\nWhen you have learned to read your dog and understand what the dog is telling you, you will have a better relationship with your dog.\n\nUntil now much of the relationship has consisted of a one-way communication: I, the owner, tell you what to do and you do what I say. This has nothing to do with a relationship.\n\nRemember that every time you are close to a dog, you have a choice how to behave. You can act in a threatening or a friendly way. There is no, absolutely NO, excuse for scaring a dog. Dogs are survivors. They defend themselves when they feel threatened. Some will try to get away, others may answer back, and whatever solution the dog decides upon, it is you who made it happen.\n\nBy telling your dog you are friendly, it does not need to feel insecure in your presence. It can change the whole relationship to your dog.\n\nYou always have a choice. Whatever the situation, dog or incident you have always this choice of what to do. You can make tiny changes like looking away instead of staring, walking slowly instead of marching or running, turning away or standing still. Or you can accept that your dog is giving you a calming signal to tell you that he is tired, or cannot concentrate any more, or that he needs a break, for example.\n\nIf you want your dog to respect you, you must also respect your dog. A good relationship is based on two-way communication, and living together in a well-balanced togetherness. Leadership does not solve anything; it only creates problems, in our lives as well as in the dogs’ lives.",

Dogs that are easily distracted, or that encounter situations where they may lunge, bark or give aggressive displays can be helped to walk calmly and quietly on a slack leash. City, town or country walking can all become more relaxed, reducing stress for dog and owner.\n\nTurid’s method is explained in simple steps with informative photographs which aid understanding, and the book includes tips on equipment to use, reasons for pulling and trouble shooting, along with case studies.\n\nBarking is natural and almost all dogs bark. It is one of the many ways dogs communicate with each other as well as with humans. In this book, author Turid Rugaas, well known for her work on identifying and utilizing canine “calming signals” to interpreting behavior, turns her attention to understanding and managing barking.\n\nThink of barking as your dog’s language. By learning to identify what your dog is expressing when he barks, you can take steps to minimize their negative effects.\n\nAlso available from Dogwise Publishing Go to www.dogwise.com for more books and ebooks.\n\nCanine Body Language A Photographic Guide Brenda Aloff\n\nYour dog is “talking.” Are you listening?

In fact, while many people assume that fearful dogs are so scared because they must have been abused in the past, itʼs far more common that the cause is lack of adequate early socialization.\n\nFrom health, to interactions with littermates, to the richness of her early environment, itʼs essential that the puppyʼs breeder or early caretaker take an active role in shaping the puppyʼs behavioral health.

She instinctively pulls herself in the direction of any heat source while reﬂexively rooting her nose whenever it touches an object. Once she ﬁnds the warm underside of her mother, her rooting pays oﬀ as she grasps a nipple and starts sucking in the warm, antibody-rich milk.\n\nDuring the ﬁrst two weeks, puppies spend most of their\n\ntime sleeping huddled with their littermates, with brief interruptions for nursing. Most of their sleep is REM or stage IV sleep—a stage characterized by involuntary twitching and high brain activity. One reason puppies sleep in a heap is that they have no shivering reﬂex or insulating fat. That means a healthy newborn can only maintain a body temperature\n\nabout12°F above her environment. In fact, her core body temperature wonʼt hit its normal of 101.5°F until she is about four weeks old.\n\nHer ability to regulate her temperature improves by about\n\nthree and a half weeks old, and then puppies tend to sleep side by side instead of in a heap. Later on they may sleep more spread out. But even so, puppies and dogs often choose to sleep in contact with a wall, object, or person.\n\nAt this age, only three of their ﬁve senses are working—\n\ntouch, taste and smell—and even these are not fully developed. With only a fraction of their senses functioning, puppies do not yet exhibit signs of fear of their environment. However, they do respond to pain, discomfort, and minor disturbances by whining.",

As humans, our ﬁrst instinct is to provide a completely protective and stress-free environment. However, some exposure to these stressors is important for puppiesʼ development. A little stress early on helps them develop the ability to cope with real life.\n\nThatʼs why the neonatal period is an ideal time to start\n\nhandling the puppies for short amounts of time. Feeling the ears, feet, tail and mouth, and holding them in diﬀerent positions for even 30 seconds to several minutes a day may greatly decrease their stress and reactivity to handling. Changes in their reactions can be seen within a week or less. The amount and type of handling may need to be tailored, based on the puppyʼs response as she matures.\n\nThis particular puppy has been handled for 30 seconds a day, starting at 3 days of age. By 14 days of age she no longer whines or struggles when held in diﬀerent\n\npositions. Lucyʼs breeder has also taken care to handle Lucy and the other puppies\n\nin her litter, which will help Lucy accept everyday interactions such as grooming,\n\ntowel-drying wet feet, and other daily care with ease.\n\nPuppies can detect taste as soon as they are born, and can\n\nshow taste preferences early on. Once they start moving around at about three weeks old, they will explore food items in their environment.",

Even as a neonate, a pupʼs sense of smell is better than ours. While the sense may not be fully developed, as the puppy matures her superior scenting ability will open up a world that humans are unable to perceive. She will grow up to have the ability to detect a drop of scent diluted in an Olympic-size pool of water, the potential to smell cancer on the breath of a human, and the ability to distinguish between individual human odors even of identical twins if both twins are present for comparison.\n\nA puppyʼs superior sense of smell opens up a world that humans are unable to perceive.\n\n1.2 Vision Starts at the End of the Neonatal Period.\n\nAlthough the eyelids open at 10 to 14 days of age, the young puppyʼs vision is poor at ﬁrst. The puppy can follow objects and respond to movement, but her vision is not sharp. The acuity will improve some, but even as adults, dogs donʼt have especially sharp vision. They donʼt need to read newspapers or street signs. And because they are much lower to the ground than humans, smell and hearing can be more useful in ﬁnding food and sensing danger, since scents and sounds can travel around objects that might block their view.\n\n1.2.1 Dogs have lower visual acuity but are better at detecting motion.\n\nEven when their vision is fully developed, the puppies will\n\nneed to stand 20 feet from an object to see what a person would see at 75 feet.

Itʼs the reason a dogʼs eyes seem to glow at night when you shine a light on them. The tapetum reﬂects light across the retina. Before the tapetum is fully developed, at 12 weeks of age, the retina has a purplish hue.\n\nDogs also have a high percentage of light-sensitive photoreceptors in their eyes. As a result, older puppies and adult dogs can see better at night compared to humans. In fact, they can see in four to ﬁve times less light than humans.\n\nContrary to older reports, dogs do see in color. Itʼs just\n\nnot as rich as color vision in humans. Humans have three diﬀerent types of color receptors, called cones, and each cone type functions best at a diﬀerent wavelength—red, green, or blue. All of the colors we humans see are produced by mixing red, green and blue light.\n\nDogs have two types of color receptors. One cone-type\n\nfunctions best in the violet-blue region and another type functions best in the yellow-green region. Consequently, dogs are a bit similar to humans who are red-green color blind.",

So for dogs, if you want them to distinguish between colors, the best colors to use are blue and yellow.\n\nIn discrimination studies, the dog is trained to indicate when he sees a circle that looks diﬀerent from the other two.

This is when they are primed for bonding to other animals and individuals, for learning that objects, people, and environments are safe, and for learning what the body cues and signals of others mean.

Puppies who do not get adequate socialization during this period tend to be fearful of unfamiliar people, or dogs, or sounds, or objects and environments. Most people mistakenly think that such dogs must have been abused early in life but their fear is most commonly a product of incomplete or inadequate socialization for the particular individualʼs needs.

You may have heard that you should wait until your puppy has gotten his shots to socialize him or until heʼs six months of age until you train him. Well, partly due to Ian Dunbar and his movement to make puppy socialization classes the norm, itʼs now more widely known that puppies need positive experiences with many people, pets and places, usually starting by at least eight weeks of age. Thatʼs because these early weeks are the prime time for puppies to form bonds with other individuals and learn to recognize other animals and environments as being safe. (More about this in chapter 6.)\n\nIf you omit this structured early learning and wait too long, as the puppy matures he may become fearful of new things. As a default behavior when heʼs afraid, he may defend himself by barking, growling at and later biting these scary stimuli.\n\nWhat we have especially learned in the past few years is\n\nthat the beneﬁts of this socialization far outweigh the risks of catching any infectious disease, as long as proper precautions are taken to protect the puppy. For instance, we recommend you walk your puppy in neighborhoods where most dogs are vaccinated and stay away from parks (especially dog parks) and other areas frequented by dogs of unknown vaccination status.",

For some precocious pups this might be so; however, many puppies taken through such a lax, abbreviated potty protocol remain only partially housetrained, or they have potty accidents for months. These little Rovers learn that pottying outside is good, but they do not understand that inside is out of bounds. In fact, they may even come inside after an extensive play or exercise period and relieve themselves on your expensive carpet.\n\nThatʼs because potty training is not only about training\n\nwhere to go. It is also about making it clear that other places are inappropriate, until pottying only in the right locations becomes a habit.",

However, men prefer to randomly urinate in public on the walls. To help train men that itʼs inappropriate to urinate in public, the city has installed “pee walls” that cause the urine to splash on their feet. They have oﬃcers assigned to what they call a Bad Behavior Brigade who ticket public pee-ers. As the Wall Street Journal reports, they are saying non non to oui oui and making it diﬃcult for men to potty in the wrong locations, in hopes that the men will form a habit of only going in the right places.\n\nIn this section Iʼll show you a foolproof potty training plan that works even for breeds known to be diﬃcult to housetrain.

It requires you control the puppyʼs environment and schedule so he does not have the chance to have accidents.”\n\nThe key to potty training is taking your young puppy out frequently (on average every two hours for an eight-week-old puppy) and never giving her the opportunity to have a potty accident.

If at any point he daydreams and forgets what heʼs going to do, the follow immediately knows and may be confused for an instant. If he is consistent in how he signals and his signals are clear, so that she understands, then she will trust his ability to lead her and they will form a stronger relationship. On the other hand, if he frequently forgets to lead or his signals are muddled, then the follow will feel the need to take the lead herself. Then itʼs just two people dancing near each other but not actually together (See video of leading like a leader in a dance, www.drsophiayin.com).\n\nThe same principle applies to training puppies and adult\n\ndogs. They have to understand what we want, and the only way that they can is if we provide clear cues and signals. Anyone can do this if we:\n\nSet clear house rules so that we can be consistent about what is expected instead of constantly changing them and confusing our pet. In this program, the rules are that the puppy must say please by automatically sitting for everything she wants.",

If youʼre not aware of what you are doing, you may be training undesirable behaviors more often than desirable ones. Thatʼs why the Learn to Earn program is so important. Our goal is to make good behavior a consistent habit, rather than a trick the puppy performs only when you bring out a treat or a behavior she performs only when you yell or threaten with enough force.\n\nThis structured program is what makes the training go so\n\nfast. By rewarding polite behaviors all the time and never rewarding the undesirable ones, puppy quickly learns to be polite all the time.\n\nIn this program weʼll use everything your puppy wants to our advantage as rewards for training purposes. Sheʼll Learn to Earn everything she wants by politely sitting and asking for it. And sheʼll learn that undesirable behaviors such as\n\njumping on you result in absolutely no rewards—no kibble, no treats, toys, play,\n\nSheʼll earn every single kibble. For the fastest training, that means no food in a food bowl. Instead, your pup is going to earn every bit of kibble during training",

Your puppy should remain tethered to you with a hands free leash such as the Buddy System, until sheʼs completely potty trained in the house (that takes a minimum of one month). Once your dog is potty trained, and when she automatically and quickly sits for everything she wants, have her wear her leash but donʼt attach it to you. Rather, let her drag the leash throughout the house. She should drag a leash around the house until she has a 100% solid come when called, the ﬁrst time you call, even when there are distractions in the house. Have her wear the leash in the house only when you are home, because it is possible for dogs to get their leashes caught in the furniture and get stuck. Having the dog wear a harness\n\nand attaching the leash to the harness instead of the neck collar for this part of the training is a good option.\n\nOnce you have the 100% solid come, the puppy doesnʼt need to wear a leash in the house but she still has to sit for everything she wants. Puppies will stay on leash in the house due to the potty training program much longer than they will need to be leashed for the Learn to Earn program.\n\nThe necessity and beneﬁts of tethering: Your puppy should be tethered to you on leash at all times when she isnʼt in her crate or pen or tethered to an object near\n\nyou. This works well for potty training, but is also important for teaching her to\n\nstick with you and that she canʼt blow you oﬀ. Some pups will wander away when",

But once sheʼs a perfect canine good citizen who greets politely, always comes when called and plays nicely with her toys and not your shoes, you can allow her to jump on you when you invite her to do so with an “up” cue and she can stand and wait at the door instead of having to sit to go out.\n\nfurniture if you want, if she asks politely by sitting.

Thatʼs why we donʼt just tell them to sit every time we want it even after they know the cue word “sit.” Instead, we make it clear by our action of waiting and rewarding the appropriate behavior that only sitting (their way of saying “please”) and looking at you works to get them what they want.\n\nWe can apply the same leave-it exercise to self control around toys. This exercise is for dogs who love toys, tug or fetch. Practicing self control around toys means your puppy will not feel the need to go after other dogsʼ toys, or to run after anything thatʼs tossed anywhere near her.\n\nWith your dog sitting (Figure 5.4.4A), toss the toy beyond the range of the leash just the way you did with the treat (Figure 5.4.4B). By now she should know she\n\nwonʼt be allowed to run to the end of the leash and pull you to the toy. So at this\n\npoint thereʼs no need to give a verbal leave-it cue; however, you can give her the\n\nleave-it cue just once if you are sure she knows it well—and then stand still in case\n\nshe does leap for the toy. If she remains seated and looking at you, give her a\n\nseries of treats, just as when you were doing this exercise by tossing food on the",

Be sure to get there fast enough so sheʼs on a loose leash\n\nWhen she has the toy you can play tug with her, so that she continues to be motivated by toys.\n\nItʼs important for puppies and dogs that go crazy over toys to learn to perform leave-it for their toys and to also learn to sit to have their toy tossed (section 5.3.4). Some people believe that you can train a dog to be well- behaved by exercising him until heʼs tired. For dogs that go bonkers over their toy, if they are allowed to bark and pace and jump and then their toy is tossed, you are actually rewarding them for this unruly behavior. So regardless of how much exercise they are getting, they are practicing impatience and this will negatively aﬀect their behavior in other high excitement situations.\n\n5.4.5 Using leave-it to wait politely at the door.\n\nYou can use one of the leave-it exercises to stop your dog\n\nfrom charging out the door whenever you open it, and to get him to sit to go out on walks. Open the door and be ready to block your dog, just as you did in the leave-it exercise where you tossed food onto the ground behind you.\n\nIf your dog tries to go out on his own, quickly block him.

The reason to continue for so long is that some dogs just need constant practice and others go through a prominent fear period some time between six months and over a year where they are more sensitive to becoming fearful again.\n\nWhile socialization is essential, itʼs important, to recognize when your puppy is afraid or has had enough of something new.

This interpretation is not quite correct. Dogs cower when\n\nthey are afraid. It could be due to fear of punishment, a loud noise, or an\n\nunfamiliar, person, object, or dog that they perceive as scary.\n\nSubmissive or de-escalating postures: The actual deﬁnition of a submissive posture is one that it intended to turn oﬀ aggression and signal that the dog\n\noﬀering the signals will not ﬁght—at least if the other dog (or person) reacts\n\nappropriately by stopping his assault. Hence submissive postures are now referred\n\nto by some scientists as de-escalating postures. These postures may or may not be\n\ndriven by fear. For instance when playing with a friend, if one dog gets too rough\n\nand the other indicates itʼs irritation by growling, the instigator may get down low\n\nbut most likely in a relaxed manner. This posture signals clearly that he is backing\n\noﬀ. If the instigator lowers her body to the ground and is tense, trembling or\n\nsuddenly moves in slow motion, this indicates fear. In both cases the appropriate\n\nresponse from the growling dog is to stop the threat too.\n\nAﬃliative gestures: Sometimes similar low body postures are exhibited in the absence of a threat. For instance, some dogs naturally greet other dogs and people\n\nby approaching with a low posture or even by lying down. Their body is relaxed",

This can work in cases where the puppyʼs fear is not intense and even in some cases where it is. But it can also be associated with some major side eﬀects.\n\nAvoid trying to handle the scary situation by just holding her down as the “danger” approaches. This might work if the fear is minor.

The quick way to teach a down-stay and to reward dogs while they are calmly lying down is with the MannersMinder® (a.k.a. Treat&Train®). Because the\n\nrewards are activated by remote control you can reward the dog when he is lying down away from you such as on the other side of the room.\n\nThe MannersMinder® comes with a timer function that\n\ntells you when to dole out treats. At ﬁrst you reward frequently—every several seconds as long as the dog remains lying down. Then you systematically and rapidly increase the interval between treats so that the dog is waiting in a down- stay longer and longer for each treat. Because of the systematic nature of the training protocol and the precise timing that occurs when treats are dispensed remotely, the down-stay can easily be trained within a few days to a few weeks depending on the amount of the dogʼs meal you will use and the type of distractions youʼre working with. Best of all you can do the training while youʼre watching T.V. or working on other tasks.\n\nTraining a down-stay with the MannersMinder® a.k.a.

Because the timing of the reward is late, the animal doesnʼt understand which behavior earned the reward. To improve our ability to communicate the desired behavior to our puppy we can train a marker sound, otherwise known as a bridging stimulus. That is, we can pair food with a unique sound like the click from a toy clicker, or a word they rarely hear, such as “yes” spoken in a distinct, sharp tone. By producing the sound and immediately following with food repeatedly, the puppy will learn that the sound predicts that the food treat is coming. Once this association is established, the sound can be used to tell the puppy exactly when he is performing a correct behavior. The puppy knows that when he hears the sound, whatever he was doing at the time has earned him a reward. In other words, the sound comes to bridge the gap between the desired behavior and the food reinforcer.",

Once she has ﬁgured this\n\nout and readily eats the kibble Iʼm using as treats, I press the remote control so that a tone sounds and the MannersMinder® immediately dispenses a kibble into the bowl.

There has been an explosion of changes in how to raise and train dogs over the past few decades, with fancy terms you’ll read about in a new Chapter 6, “Bonding with Your Puppy Using the New Science of Modern Dog Parenting.” Researchers from across the globe are doing fascinating studies — even some you can get involved with that reveal how dogs communicate and learn best. The good news for trainers who use positive reinforcement and encouragement to teach their students how to behave? Many studies show that dogs learn most quickly in the first months of puppyhood and respond best to training that encourages their focus and reinforces good behavior. Goodbye to the alphacentric approach, where correcting the puppy for what they’re doing wrong instead of teaching them how to act right, is the order of the day. Research has shown what many dog lovers have long recognized as common sense:\n\n» A domineering approach is inextricably tied to the practice of physical\n\n» Electronic collars that buzz, spray, or shock clearly terrify puppies.\n\nAlphacentric training philosophies create fear and (as studies show) don’t train or teach puppies to be friendly, happy, well-mannered family members. Trust me: You won’t find support for that approach in this book.\n\nWhat you will find is a common-sense approach to selecting your puppy, loving hints to help you through those first critical months, and support in problem- solving and training. You’ll find straightforward info in plain English on what to do and how to do it. Nothing more and nothing less — I promise.",

    "page_content": "Even though raising a puppy is also a daily responsibility (and a huge one, at that), it’s like many other projects in life: After you understand how to determine what your puppy is thinking, and after you find out how you can communicate with them effectively and structure your environment to limit your frustrations, the day-to-day tasks and problems immediately become simpler. The comment I hear most often from clients after our initial visit is this: “You are a miracle worker!” But I know that the real miracle is the puppy. Like an interpreter, I just facilitate the communication between the two species.\n\nRaising a child is a big project that is only made easier by reading a stack of how-to books and organizing systems, like mealtimes and potty routines, that eventually become habits. Fortunately for you, puppy raising is nearly identical, with the bonus that, unlike children who take a couple of decades to mature, a puppy matures within a year. Puppies For Dummies, 4th Edition, will help you sim- plify this whole adventure from the onset of choosing a puppy for your family to managing your puppy’s day-to-day needs, training and playing, and dealing with everyday frustrations. Behind every happy puppy is a supportive, understanding, and nurturing family cheering them on!\n\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed by this project now, don’t despair: This book gives you a whole new outlook, provides easy steps to resolve annoyances, and helps you civilize your puppy in no time flat. In this book, which is meant to be an all-inclusive guide, I walk you through the early decisions — purebred or rescue, low shedding or superfuzzy, big or small — and then provide everything you need to know to raise your puppy right. I’m excited to get started!",

Except for anything that’s strictly related to females or males, you can be sure that the info applies to your puppy regardless of gender.\n\n» Anytime I introduce a new term, I italicize it. » Keywords in lists appear in boldface. Also, when I present a list of steps to\n\nperform, the action you need to take is in boldface.\n\nPlease don’t be stressed by the size of this book. I know, right? Who has the time to read a 400-page book from cover to cover? Of course, you can, but I wrote each chapter as a stand-alone unit and would be just as pleased if you used this book as a quick reference guide. If you’re pressed for time, use the trusty index\n\nguide to find what you need and go there. Don’t need help choosing the right puppy or talking to breeders or shelters? Then there’s no need for you to read chapters that help with those situations. And, though the sidebars contain infor- mation that fascinates me, it’s not Required Reading. Finally, if you’re in a real hurry, you can skip any paragraphs that have the Technical Stuff or Just for Fun icons attached to them.\n\nBottom line? I’m thrilled that you’ve picked my book off the shelf — I’ve written it with you and your puppy in mind. As far as how you read it?

Living with a puppy, especially one that’s just been separated from their mom and littermates, can be a bit of a buzzkill. What should you expect? How should you deal with the barking and whining — especially when it happens in the middle of the night? How do you act when your puppy grabs something you’d rather they didn’t, or chases the cat or nips the kids? You can find all the answers in Part 2. Plus, you learn about the new science of modern dog training, which reinforces techniques I’ve long encouraged. Research shows that puppies, like young children, can pick up routines almost immediately, making those early weeks super-important. In this part, you’ll learn about how your puppy’s needs affect their behavior, why sleep training is crucial for a happy life, and why consistency with friends and family helps to shape good behavior from the start.\n\nWhether you’re starting this book with a little pup or an adolescent, this part of the book speaks to the off-leash wannabe in all of us. Leashes are often hard to wrangle, and no one wants to get hauled around in the name of training, least of all your dog. In this part, you’ll discover how off-leash training is something you can shape at any age with the use of some cool tools and groovy gadgets. As you master lessons, I’ll delve into different training styles to find the approach that works best for you and your puppy — from clickers to target training.",

Rather than look at your puppy’s behaviors as good or bad, examine them from your puppy’s perspective. Everything your puppy does has value as it communi- cates their worldview; over the course of this book, you’ll find out how to interpret their reactions so that you can develop a mindful approach to training and resolv- ing stress. You’ll feel proactive and empathetic when dealing with specific issues such as separation stress, noise reactivity, anxiety, and even aggression. The best part is that your relationship with your puppy will grow stronger from working together to resolve whatever issues arise.\n\nYour first choice is whether you want your puppy to learn good manners and listening skills or whether you’d rather condition annoying routines and dismis- sive behavior. You read that sentence correctly: The choice is up to you. If it’s the former, Part 4 is for you. I cannot wait to show you how to encourage your puppy’s cooperative behavior from the start. In these chapters, I go over first lessons (how to teach your puppy to sit, stay, and come) before moving on to more complex routines, like where to potty and how to greet people at the door.

    "page_content": "Puppies are a lot like kids: They act well when they feel good. If your goal is a happy, friendly, well-mannered dog, take good care of them inside and out. In this part, you’ll find all you need to know on nutrition, exercise, and grooming. Also, since no one wants to get sick or be sidelined by accident, least of all your dog, it’s important to know the signs and symptoms of an illness and be on the ready should anything bad happen. Part 5 provides lists and quick skills as well as a do-it-yourself doggie first-aid kit to prepare, just in case life ever presents your dog with the unexpected.\n\nLast but not least, in Part 6 I give you ten of my favorite games and ten crowd- pleasing tricks. Enjoy!\n\nYou’ll find icons throughout this book on the left side of the page that point to different sorts of info. Here’s the list of the various icons you’ll encounter:\n\nThis icon highlights useful tidbits and helpful advice — such as how to lift your puppy and hold them just right to give them that loving feeling.\n\nHere is where I get to stress the main points — such as rewarding what your puppy is doing right and responding in such a way that the wrong behavior doesn’t result in more attention.\n\n“Warning, warning!” Need I say more? Don’t skip this one.\n\nThis icon alerts you to factoids and technical information that, though fascinat- ing, is more for the dog-obsessed folks than everyday folks just trying to get a handle on their puppy’s behavior.\n\nI love to have fun, so this is my favorite icon! Though not necessary to learning, these tidbits give you a fresh and fun way to spin requests so that your puppy will use a behavior, like sitting, to get you to throw their toy again and again and again. You can skip these tips, but who’d want to?",

To get this Cheat Sheet, visit www.dummies.com and type Puppies For Dummies Cheat Sheet in the Search box.\n\nThe coolest thing about this book is that you can jump in anywhere. It’s a no-rules reference guide whether you’re in the early stages of thinking about getting a puppy or you have one already chewing on your shoelace.\n\nThough you can read the book from cover to cover, feel free to take a quick skim of the table of contents to choose your topic and dig right in. Regardless of where you start, remember this principle and you can’t go wrong: Puppies are a lot like babies. They need to be nurtured but not spoiled, loved but not overindulged. Just like kids, they need guidelines and limits, not unlimited freedom. At the end of the day, you’re the dog parent, and it’s your responsibility to keep your puppy safe. Use the training lessons — mainly formatted in Chapters 10-13 but sprinkled throughout the book — to teach your puppy what words mean, and then use those words to organize where they should go and what they should do in every situation.\n\nThank you for picking up my book and adding it to your library. Everyone needs help sometimes, and raising a puppy is no small task. But with time and informa- tion, things do get easier — even enjoyable. I’ve taken special care to organize this book so that each section teaches you how to successfully communicate with your puppy and raise them to be a wonderful family member, now and always.",

This is where you get to make a positive impression, shape their personality for the better, and socialize them to sound and daily routines that they’ll discover in your home. They’re needy and dependent on you, so make the most of this time together. Chapter 10 will guide you!\n\n» Teaching Your Pre-Adolescent Puppy (16 weeks to 6 months): Before the terrible twos start, you may be convinced that you’ve adopted an angel. Then it happens almost overnight: Your puppy falls from grace. If it’s any consola- tion, all their mischief is a wonderful sign of normal development. Your puppy is growing up. Most people notice more confidence during this stage and less of a help-me attitude and more of a can-do spirit. Embrace it. Chapter 11 shows you the way!\n\n» Surviving the Teenage Months (6 months to 9 months): Okay, by now\n\nyou’re getting a good glimpse of your puppy’s lifelong personality quirks. Are they needy, confrontational, strong-willed, dependent, focused, obstinate? Your puppy is maturing faster than you can keep up. Now is the time to start fun, positive training routines and to increase games that encourage interac- tion. Fortunately for you, bad habits are easy to phase out during this stage if you can remember to stay cool. Puppies are still eager to please during this stage and are motivated to behave to get what they want — from treats to toys and attention. Chapter 12 tells you what you need to know.",

Anger and frustration will spell your ruin — your puppy won’t understand you, and they’ll react with confusion and, possibly, defensiveness.\n\n» Striving for Off Lead Control (9 to 12 months): At this point, for the most part you can see the light at the end of the dark tunnel. During this phase, if you’ve been consistent with training, you’ll often have a super puppy — devoted, responsive, and mindful. Well, that is to say, most of the time.

By thinking thoughtfully about these topics, you can start to narrow in on the best puppy for your home. (And, after you develop a sense of your ideal dog, the breed discussion in Chapter 3 helps you hone in on just the right pet.)\n\nLiving Your Dream: Pinpointing What You Really Want\n\nEveryone wants a perfect dog: a well-mannered, loving companion who gets along with the family and is a joy to be around 24/7. But the reality is, perfect dogs aren’t born that way — they develop from good-enough puppyhoods. As with children, your dog’s behavior is a direct reflection of the time you’ve spent condi- tioning their cooperation and socializing and training them during their puppy- hood phases. Throughout this book, I outline the effort that goes into coaching your puppy into a well-balanced, friendly, responsive dog.\n\nThe best place to start isn’t even with the puppy — it’s with you. If you’re in the early stages, just considering what type of dog will best fit into your lifestyle, use this chapter to lay out all your options. Use the following questionnaire to help you focus on what you want and determine the type of puppy that will fit in best.\n\nWhen forming the mental picture of your perfectly suited companion, don’t ask yourself what sort of puppy you want. Instead, ask what sort of dog you want. All pups traverse their first year through the typical phases, from the curious, nip- ping early days to the defiant adolescence and dismissive teen, but they spend the bulk of their lives in a mature state that’s largely predictable based on breed- specific characteristics.",

Most people find an 8-week- old Golden Retriever puppy irresistible, and you may melt at the sight of a shar-pei puppy, but fast-forward ten months: Will your likes and dislikes line up with the adult versions of these puppies?\n\nTo improve the likelihood of a happy and lasting relationship, think about what you’re looking for in a dog. Big or small? Active or less energetic? Dependent and responsive off-leash or independent and spirited? There’s a dog for every descrip- tion! The questionnaire in the next section helps you narrow down your wants from the many possibilities.\n\nLiving with a dog is more like having a toddler than sharing your life with a cat or containable pet. A hamster or chinchilla can fill their minimum daily exercise requirements (MDER) by jogging on an exercise wheel as he basically lives and dies happily within the confines of their living space. A dog will go insane left in a cage all day. Puppies are sociable creatures whose main focus in life is food and fun. Because they’re reliant on you for basic care and well-being (just like a tod- dler), you’ll be correct in thinking of yourself as a dog parent versus a dog owner or master.\n\nHow much time your puppy-soon-to-be-dog requires for exercise fun, grooming, and attention depends largely on these three factors:",

Consider the next decade plus a few years: Do you have hopes for the future? It’s time to be honest with yourself and your family so that everybody wins!\n\nSure, a 6 a.m. run with your well-trained companion sounds great on paper, but if you’re addicted to the Snooze button, you’ll quickly grow to resent a puppy who just can’t be shut down.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re an athlete, psyched to have a running companion, spend time choosing a breed or mix that will be eager to keep up with you. Got young kids? A protective breed of any size, bent on alert barking every time some- one ventures near the front door, may not be the best choice if your home is the hub of weekly PTA and after-school get-togethers.\n\nThis questionnaire is split into three subsections to better help you gain perspec- tive on yourself and your choice in selecting a breed or mixed breed. If you’re committed to caring for a puppy and meeting their needs, and if you can muster up the patience to deal with typical puppy phases, you’re certainly on your way to a lovely, lifelong bond with your puppy.

Keep the questionnaire in mind (make a copy if you need to) as I walk you through the description of the various breeds or mixed breeds in Chapter 3.\n\nEven though your dog’s appearance shouldn’t be a chief motivating factor in your breed selection, it’s still important. You may have strong preferences based on aesthetics, such as what tail or facial features make you smile, and you can narrow down the breeds you look at based on those criteria. You may also be concerned with practical matters — what care is involved in owning a curly or thick-coated dog. Questions 1 through 5 guide you along and help you narrow your decision.\n\nCertain features affect the cost of owning a dog, and that consideration may be an important one for you. When you’re considering your dream dog, consider hidden perks and drawbacks tied to the appearance of each individual breed: For example, breeds with nonshedding hair will save you from fur- covered furniture, but they do require regular trips to the groomer. Long-, thick-, or curly-coated dogs also need professional grooming periodically. And you may love the look of bigger dogs, but they cost more to feed than small or tiny dogs.",

A high-energy dog who is pent-up, isolated, or underexercised can become destructive, clingy, and impulsive. These behaviors will no doubt be frustrating for your family, so be sure you can provide what your dog needs.\n\n» Questions 9 through 12: How involved in your life would you like your dog to be?

Training a dog of a protective or hunting breed to bark only at the right things and for a limited period of time are key consider- ations throughout their first year. The amount of time you need to commit to training and shaping your puppy is directly determined by the breed and the personality of each individual puppy.

Consider your favorite pastime and find a puppy who will grow up to be in the same groove as you. For example, if you’ve got a fetish for Frisbees, you have to decide whether you want a dog who fetches them relentlessly or one who shows no interest (so that you can actually play a civilized game with friends or family). A dog bred to course fields all day herding, hunting, or retrieving waterfowl will grow insanely restless and destructive if they’re cooped inside all day. A companion dog, however, will enjoy the serenity of calm, predictable activities and will need far less exercise to stay on an even keel.\n\n» Question 19: Introducing a new puppy to other pets in your household can\n\nbe tricky, so take this question seriously. If you breed prize-winning rabbits or own cats, avoid breeds genetically programmed to kill them. If you have another dog, choose a breed that will mesh with their traits and personality. Other pets? Even those in glass cages can elicit your dog’s drive to chase and capture. If you have any other pets, consider a breed with a more chilled reaction to other animals.\n\n» Question 20: If you have other considerations, think through them in terms of the future.

    "page_content": "The age you bring home a puppy is an important consideration. The earliest age you bring home a puppy should be eight weeks old, although this should not be the first time your puppy is around people. You will learn a lot about choosing a rescue puppy or breeder in Chapter 4, but for now remember that your puppy should be raised inside and around people and household noises from the moment’s they’re born. You may hear the term impressionable or the even fancier term imprinting, which relates to how often your developed puppy was handled and exposed to different noises and stimulations. Although you may think that your puppy should grow up in a bubble during their early weeks, you would be wrong. Studies show that puppies exposed to the chaos of everyday life and handled by friendly people are better able to adapt to life with you when they come home.\n\nIf you bring home a young-young puppy (younger than 12 weeks of age), they’ll need a lot of socialization, supervision, and consideration. You’ll need to continue to expose them to lots of sights and sounds, bringing them out in a carrying case or on leash after your veterinarian says it’s safe to do so. (More on this adventure in Chapter 9.) Little puppy bladder muscles aren’t fully developed; their teeth are falling out at a rapid pace, they’re unsure of themselves, and, in short, they can be overreactive to everyday occurrences, spelling out hyperexcitement or distress. If the thought of midnight potty runs leaves you feeling cool to the idea of raising a young puppy, perhaps you’d be better suited to adopting an older puppy or dog. Puppies older than four months begin to have better bladder control and are well through their nipping and teething phases, so you may have an easier time with them.",

    "page_content": "If you like the idea of getting an older puppy (between four months and a year, for example), make sure you do a thorough background check, paying close attention to the type of social experiences your candidate had during the first critical months of life. Find one that has been raised inside a house and around lots of people and other dogs. The first six months of a dog’s life is a critical socialization period, where your dog either grows comfortable of their surroundings or wary of new experiences. If you adopt a little puppy, you have control over this time and can shape your puppy’s life experiences; if you adopt an older puppy, make sure they’ve had the right type of social experiences to fit in with your lifestyle.\n\nAs far as where to go to find an older puppy, start by visiting a local shelter or perusing rescue organizations online through sites such as www.petfinders.com or www.adoptapet.com. Shelters are filled with older puppies and dogs, and you can easily find rescue clubs for specific breeds on the Internet or through a local kennel club. (In the United States, www.AKC.org is a good place to start.) Some- times a breeder may hold on to a puppy longer for various reasons, such as an adopter backed out, the puppy displayed show potential, a puppy is returned, or a puppy is held for medical reasons. If this option sounds promising to you, ask the same essential questions I list in Chapter 4, such as where the puppy was raised during their critical imprinting stage (from birth to four months old) and whether they are housetrained and socialized. Your puppy cannot change their early influ- ences and you do not want to get stuck with a puppy who has spent their whole life in a kennel or living outside.",

Consider your current lifestyle: your routines, your schedule, the demands of your home life. Are you expecting? Retiring soon? These are questions you should ask as you begin the process. And don’t forget that dogs live a long, long time (8 to 12 years on average; some, even longer), so you need to consider the big picture. For example, though you may be single now, are you envisioning marriage and children? If so, get a breed or mixed breed that will groove with the chaos and taunting of young children. Where are you now, and where do you think you’ll be five or even ten years from now?\n\nChildren add a lot of pizazz to anyone’s life. Your furry, 4-legged child is no exception. If you’re half of a newly married couple eager to title your puppy “our first child,” you’ll have to socialize your puppy extensively with babies so that they don’t feel displaced when you welcome your second (human) child someday.\n\nYou’re single and free and have few responsibilities to tie you down. Even though the constant companionship of a puppy may sound dreamy, it’s a major respon- sibility and one you’ll have to shoulder 100 percent.

Most cafes frown on inviting in anything but the human species, and your puppy will not sit still for hours at a time. Walking, grooming, and feeding your puppy all require a mindfulness that leaves your carefree days in the dust.\n\nIf you’re truly up for the challenge, remember that your puppy will be your responsibility for a decade or more. If you plan to share a household with someone eventually, socialize your puppy well so that they won’t get their hackles up when that special someone sweeps you off your feet. Also, think about whether you may have a family of your own someday. If it seems likely, choose a breed that enjoys children, and start socializing your puppy with kids from the get-go. (Flip to Chapter 9 for more on puppy socialization.)\n\nIt’s just you and your honey, but a puppy makes three. Owning a puppy together is your first true test of cooperation. Raising a puppy is a lot easier with two people to share the responsibilities, but consistency is a key factor. If the two of you join forces, following similar guidelines for structure and training, your puppy will mature quickly and thrive in the consistency. But if one of you wants the puppy to feel at home on the furniture and eat from a dish at the table and the other person prefers a more structured approach, your puppy’s worldview will be skewed, and they won’t know which rules apply or when.",

Have a heartfelt talk with your partner — ideally, before bringing your puppy home. Be sure to discuss the following topics:\n\n» What are your separate visions and hopes for adding a dog to your life? » Where will the puppy sleep? » How will you share responsibilities, from feeding and walking to exercise and\n\n» What are your feeding philosophies, from kibbles in the bowl to handouts\n\n» How much money will you apportion to training, grooming, and maintaining\n\nYour puppy will live and love most serenely in a household where you can both agree.\n\nIf you and your partner are retired empty nesters, now may be a terrific time to get a puppy, because you’re probably home more often and have time to be attentive to your puppy’s schedule. However, remember that a young puppy’s needs can be quite demanding. If you already completed the 4 a.m. diaper-changing routine and you’d rather skip these experiences than relive them, consider an older puppy who has been in a supportive environment or one whom the breeder is willing to socialize and train for you. Also, pay close attention to the exercise requirements when choosing a puppy. You need to ensure that you and your soon-to-be-adult dog are a solid match.\n\nIf you’re getting a puppy to raise with your young child, you may suddenly feel like you have twins (except that one is slightly furrier than the other). Raising a puppy with children younger than the age of 5 is a tremendous undertaking, and it’s one that often creates more stress than it’s worth.",

Though a tight squeeze may signal love from your 3-year-old to you, it can instill panic or frighten a young pup. A squeezed puppy may feel trapped and bite defensively, even if under normal circumstances they wouldn’t react this way. This puppy can mature into a dog with an innate fear of young children or into a dog who’s immediately tense in their company.\n\nIf you have a needy toddler, postpone getting a puppy for at least a couple of years. Your child needs all your attention to develop a strong sense of self. A puppy will pull you away from your parental duties and rival the toddler for your attention. This situation is almost guaranteed to cause some headaches. Introduce the puppy after your child is more emotionally steady and is also excited and ready for the addition.\n\nIf you’re convinced this is the right time to add a puppy to your family, consider the option of an older puppy who has been well socialized to children during their first few months. Find a 6- to 10-month-old puppy who has been given up for reasons such as a move or human allergies to the puppy. After they’re past the intense nipping phase, puppies are less likely to think of the kids as littermates, also known as siblings. As a bonus, an older puppy has better bladder control and may already be completely house-trained.\n\nAre you ready to take the plunge?

Bear in mind that any change in schedule, caregiver, or location will upset your puppy’s routine and may result in hyperactivity, nervousness, or backsliding in training (including house-training).\n\nIf you already have a menagerie, look for a breeder who has exposed his or her puppies to other animals at a young age.

If you’re new to dogs and puppies, you may be surprised to learn that even though they’re all built pretty much the same, each one has its own personality, and each one faces the world in unique ways. Some thrive on human interaction; others prefer an independent lifestyle. Some love the general mayhem created by small children, whereas others find it less than thrilling. Some see houseguests as long-lost friends, and others see them as potential enemies. Some dogs cherish quiet, solitary times; others eat your house if you come home too late. What sounds good to you? Fortunately, you can choose with reasonably good predictability!\n\nIf researching the right dog for your lifestyle sounds overwhelming, you’ll love this chapter. In moments, you’ll be in the know after reading advice that’s stream- lined and tailored just for you.

Each will have valid points that may tug at your heart, but where you get your puppy and how you chose to raise them is your decision (to be made with your family, if you have one). Raising a puppy is a huge commitment, one just below raising a child, so do it right. This chapter educates you on the difference between the choices of rescu- ing a puppy and buying one from a breeder.\n\nChoosing the breeder route versus the rescue route\n\nWhen you purchase a purebred dog, you’re buying into a multigenerational breed- ing effort. Individuals, known as breeders, devote their lives to matching dogs in their never-ending quest to produce healthy, conformationally sound, and emo- tionally consistent puppies. That’s a good deal for you if you’re the one purchas- ing a puppy.\n\nA puppy bought from a breeder costs money; a shelter, transfer, or abandoned puppy costs far less. Here’s the reason. Breeders are individuals whose only focus is to raise a specific breed of dog — or to design a specific mix of breeds, such as a Labradoodle or Maltipoo — to produce healthy puppies. These breeding\n\nprograms find the healthiest parents for their puppies and ensure that the puppies they produce have a head start in socializing and training before you even bring them home. Your money is paying for that service.",

This is not to say that you cannot condition these pups to life as you live it, but you’ll need to invest a lot more time upfront, especially if your puppy is wary or defensive of new experiences.\n\nDo you have the time and presence of mind to socialize a puppy who is unfamiliar with new experiences? If not, are you willing to pay a trainer or puppy daycare center to do extra socialization for you? If not, seek out a reputable breeder or find a shelter or rescue organization who has raised your potential puppy with its birth family to be sure that their early experiences were crafted from the start.\n\nOf course, you will have a lot to do after your puppy comes home (see the chapters in Part 2), but early social experiences with home and family life must be crafted to condition your puppy to roll with the punches, so to speak. That’s what takes extra know-how and time if your puppy has had no experience before you adopt them.\n\nIf you decide to take the purebred dog route, remember that well-respected breeders are worth their weight in gold. These individuals start socializing and handling their puppies from the second the puppies are born so that, by the time you pick up your puppy (around eight weeks), they’ll be familiar with human handling, being restrained, and living life indoors.",

For starters, good breeders will have as many questions for you as you do for them and will insist that you sign a contract that includes health and behavior guarantees. This document also insists that you return the puppy to the breeder should anything happen that causes you to rehome them. (To learn more about what qualifies a good breeder, flip to Chapter 4 and find a list of their qualities.)\n\nWhat are some other differences between a purebred and a mixed breed? Purebred dogs cost more — between $600 and $6,000. (The high end of that range is rare, but some championship show dogs and unique designer-mixed-breed dogs can fetch this price).\n\nMixed-breed dogs, also known as random breeds or mutts, are created when pure- bred dogs (or other mutts) mate with another breed or mixed-breed dog. This dog will have a random mix of traits from two or more parents. No two mutts are ever alike in look or personality.\n\nJust as capable of love and devotion as purebreds, mixed-breed puppies often happen by accident when people don’t spay or neuter their dogs and then forget to contain or watch their dogs. Because this often happens in parts of the world where leash laws and spay-and-neuter ordinances aren’t reinforced, many of these “oops” litters are uploaded to sites like petfinder.com or adoptapet.com or transported to shelters or adoption agencies where there’s a bigger need for pre- cious “adoptables.” The bottom line? A mixed-breed dog is every bit as delightful as a purebred dog and is, some argue, healthier mentally and physically by virtue of hybrid vigor.",

Though the theory has been questioned, it claims that you get a larger range of possible traits by matching two completely different breeds.\n\nPurebred or designer-mixed-breed dogs generally offer more predictability regarding their looks and interests, which can be both a plus and a minus, as you’ll soon discover. A random mix will have a more blended look and feel, with certain qualities of either parent more dominant than others. Finding a breed that’s predisposed to a trait or look you admire, or figuring out which breed types you’d prefer in your mixed-breed puppy, takes much of the guesswork out of assessing the puppy’s developing look, behaviors, and needs.\n\nThe designer-mixed breed is the latest craze to hit the dog world. To create a designer-mixed breed, breeders mindfully mate two purebred dogs to create a new, unique breed. This idea began with an attempt to create hypoallergenic seeing-eye dogs by mating standard poodles with Labrador retrievers. The result- ing dogs were coined labradoodles, and though they didn’t catch on as seeing-eye dogs, the craze caught on in the public sector. Now breeders have created designer mixes of every shape and size, and the list of designer breeds is nearing 100. Table 3-1 shows just a few of these fun new breeds.",

Are you wondering how a breeder can get away with selling these mixed breeds at such high prices? Some are in it just for the money, following current trends and selling their puppies online to any buyer. Other breeders are as serious about their lines of designer breeds as breeders of single breed lines, making the same effort to choose healthy parents with health clear- ances and stellar temperaments to create puppies with these same qualities.\n\nFor example, the puggle (a pug-and-beagle cross) has a longer snout than the pug, which is genetically healthier, hands down. Most owners hope that with this cross, personality-wise, the beagle’s scent-chasing obsessions will be toned down and that the marginally higher trainability of the pug will seep in.\n\nIf you’re considering a designer breed, you can’t exactly be sure of what you’ll get. A purebred dog’s size, weight, and interests can be predicted. A mixed-breed dog, designer or not, has a random mix of either trait in no particular order. If you’re thinking of buying one of these fun and fancifully named breeds, make sure you like both mixes — you can end up with the look of one and the personality of the other.\n\nEverything about your puppy is predetermined by the combination of traits avail- able from each parent. The dog pros would say that each puppy has its own, unique genetic inscription — for the coat color and the tail type right down to the sound of their barks and their reactions to strangers. Just as humans are pairings of their parents’ traits, so are dogs. When similar dogs are bred consistently over many generations, the puppies will begin to look and act like their parents.

A West Highland white terrier, for example, is always white, with little variation. If this breed mated with a black-and-tan cocker spaniel, however, the puppies would have varying coat colors. Because the coat types of those two breeds are also different, each mixed-breed puppy would come out with its unique look.\n\nBecause purebred dogs have a more limited pool of genetic choices, health-related considerations can often be passed from parent to puppy: Some examples are hip or elbow dysplasia; chronic skin, eye, and ear conditions; heart murmurs; and eyelid malformations. Because mixed-breed dogs have a larger pool of genes to work with, they have more random occurrences of these ailments and, some would argue, are healthier for it. In Chapter 4, you learn the right questions to ask potential breeders (or rescue organizations, if they know the parents) to ensure that your puppy’s parents have clearances on every one of them.",

Finding one that’s best suited to adapt to your lifestyle and family comes down to discovering the breed or mixed-breed whose worldview is most similar to your personality. Are you hardworking, sporty, sensually oriented, feisty? Finding a dog with qualities you can relate to is easier than you think. The first step is to get a better handle on the term purebred, a term lots of people use without really understanding what it means.\n\nPurebred dogs are a relatively new phenomenon on the dog evolution trail. Having lived alongside us for over 14,000 years, the mindful breeding of dogs began only a few hundred years ago. Until that time, dogs generally reflected the landscape of where they lived: short-coated dogs in the hotter climates, thicker-coated dogs in the northern hemisphere, sure-footed dogs in the mountains, and so on.\n\nOnce people figured out that they could mix and match dogs to produce puppies of similar size and temperament or to suit their fancy, they began to pair dogs to serve their individual needs. Farmers bred dogs to guard or herd their flocks; merchants used dogs to move their produce or deliver goods from one town to the next; and hunters developed breeds to retrieve or to alert to their chosen\n\nquarry (a fancy term for a defenseless animal such as a bunny, bird, or fox). Breeds were created for many other purposes too, from border patrol to dog racing to mere cuddling. Dogs have been bred to do so many tasks over the millennia that scientists view dogs as integral in our species evolution.",

To remedy the confusion, dog fanciers founded breed clubs whose job it is to track litters down to each puppy: Think of a gigantic family tree, doggie style. Various countries have parent clubs that not only register dogs but also organize get-togethers (known as dog shows) and sporting events to highlight different breeds’ form and functionality. In the U.S., this not-for-profit club is known as the American Kennel Club, or AKC. The club is also responsible for defining how dogs should look, move, and act (known as the breed’s standard), and it recognizes dogs who come closest to the organization’s ideal.\n\nThe AKC, as well as other breed clubs — the Canadian Kennel Club, the Nordic Union Kennel Club, and the original Kennel Club located in the United Kingdom, for example — organize the different breeds they recognize into various subgroupings that highlight similarities between the breeds. In the following sections, I give you a quick description of the seven breed groups listed by the AKC.\n\nA proactive lot, dogs in the Sporting group were bred to help man sustain them- selves by flushing (scaring out of hiding) birds and retrieving the ones that their masters shot. In this day and age, you’re unlikely to shoot your supper from the sky, but don’t tell that to your dog. Born with a fetching fetish, these breeds thrive on an active and involved lifestyle and won’t retire just because you’re well fed. No ducks to claim or birds to point out?

But when they don’t get enough playtime or training, they can be hyperactive and destructive.\n\nEven though the loyal and cheerful dogs in the Sporting group have well-earned reputations as patient family pets, they need both mental and physical stimulation. They can’t cope with long hours of isolation; coupled with a lack of exercise, this isolation fuels anxiety. An unhappy Sporting dog is destructive, hyperactive, and impulsive. This isn’t a good mix — especially for your couch and end table.\n\nThe dogs in the Hound group are a happy lot with a 1-track mind; their fascination with hunting propels them through life and allows them plenty of opportunity for employment. Though you may have no interest in hunting a fox, chasing deer, or treeing a raccoon, your hound puppy probably will.\n\nOriginally teamed in pairs or packs, each hound was prized for their instinct to follow game without depending on human direction. As a result, a hound’s friendly manner and pack mentality result in a dog who enjoys family life yet is generally independent enough to entertain themselves.\n\nThe Beagle, Greyhound, Irish Wolfhound, and the Foxhound are in this group.\n\nThere are two types of hound: those that hunt by following the scent of their chosen pre, and others who trail animals by sight — commonly referred to as Scent hounds and Sight hounds. Both should be kept on a lead when outdoors, because their instinct to chase hasn’t been bred out of them and you can’t outrun them. In addition, you should socialize both to common household pets (like cats, birds, and rabbits) at an early age; otherwise, they may confuse them for lunch!",

Whether participating in guarding, pulling a cart or sled, water retrieval, protecting, or performing police work, they’re a task-oriented group.\n\nThe breeds in the Working group may be large, but if they’re nurtured with con- sistency, training, and exercise, they can adapt to any lifestyle with ease. When living in the country, these dogs must be contained to keep them from roaming off in pursuit of some self-assigned task. They can adapt to apartment dwelling when given daily walks and an occasional romp in the dog park.\n\nCarefully consider your situation before choosing a guard dog. Raising children and dogs is challenge enough. Territorial breeds can overstate their job as guard- ian, protecting your home and children against all intruders — including friends, extended family members, daily workers, and even other children. These dogs quickly suffer career stress in busy houses. If your heart’s set on a territorial breed, structured training is a must.\n\nThe Herding group breeds were developed during the agricultural age, when their herding skills were prized by caretakers of sheep and cattle across the globe. Man put great effort into fine-tuning these herding instincts when developing the breeds in this group. Even though these skills are no longer a priority, each dog’s behavior in the home is reflective of them. For example, a dog bred to herd sheep is often seen herding children. If properly socialized as to not view your home and the people in it as field and flock, these dogs — trained and exercised — are deeply loyal.",

For herders that are understimulated, their pacing creates a well-trodden path in a yard or field. Herding dogs must be trained, lest they adopt their people or children as sheep to protect. Cattle dogs are serious-minded, strong, and stocky dogs who can develop repetitive behaviors such as nipping your (or your children’s) moving ankles.\n\nThe breeds in the Terrier group were designed to either track down vermin in barns or fight other animals for sport. Determined and tenacious by design, they work independently and don’t prioritize human direction. Because they’re spir- ited and spunky and not easily impressed or persuaded, terriers aren’t a great match for control freaks. Even though they thoroughly enjoy human companion- ship and a good romp, they must be confined or leashed to prevent roaming or hunting.\n\nDon’t be surprised if your terrier lifts their lip as you reach, or anyone else reaches, for their bone or food bowl. It’s a natural reaction called spatial aggression, and it’s similar to what a young child does when he doesn’t want to share a favorite toy (although, hopefully, your kid doesn’t growl). Other dogs known for this behavior include some Working breeds, hounds, and certain toy breeds. For suggestions on overcoming this dilemma, refer to Chapter 18.\n\nAlthough terriers traditionally bred to fight other animals have a combative his- tory, most of the breeding lines have all but extinguished this impulse.

When choos- ing a dog from this group, trace its history or talk openly with the breeder or previous owner about their breeding philosophy and the temperaments of the dog’s parents.\n\nThe lovable little miniatures in the Toy group have been bred down from larger dogs. Even though they can be cuddle companions, many still have their original breed characteristics firmly set. Take the miniature pinscher (or min pin), for example. A distant relative of the Doberman pinscher, the min pin is an astute watchdog who sounds visitors’ arrival before they even knock at the door.\n\nWhen assessing specific breeds, research their ancestry. Even though their size is different from their ancestors’ size, their genetic impulses may be undeniably similar. Don’t pass on training them simply because of their toy-like appearance.\n\nConstant affection without direction results in a Napoleon-like complex, which is reflected in behaviors from chronic barking to marking and, often, aggression. You’d be surprised at how much damage a 5-pound dog can inflict!\n\nToy breeds are fragile by design. Even though certain breeds are stockier (the pug and the Cavalier King Charles spaniel, for example), they’re all tiny — especially as puppies.

It doesn’t often happen, but be prepared. Always remember that nothing is more disappointing (for you and the pup) than bringing a puppy home and finding that it isn’t a good fit. Finding your forever puppy is worth the wait. Think of the advice and tips in this chapter as my way to teach you how to find a puppy that connects with you and each member of the family.\n\nOne vital stage of any puppy’s life happens before you even bring them home. Dur- ing that early stage, from birth to 8 weeks old, the type of environment surround- ing them forms them in ways that will impact their behavior in your home. A puppy from a peaceful environment, where the owners mindfully nurture the parent dogs and puppies, is generally better equipped to handle the transition into a new home than a puppy who has lived in an overcrowded, neglected kennel and who has been severed from their litter at an early age. The reason is simple: A puppy’s brain is still developing even after they come out of the womb, and it continues until they’re 12 weeks old. Life stress can have a much greater impact at this time.",

Boys, however, are known, generally speaking, for being more clinging and dependent than females. If you have dogs at home, avoid hav- ing two female dogs under the same roof. Adult females can be a little ornery while living together (just imagine!) and often get along better with male com- panions. Of course, if you have a male dog, they can roll either way.\n\nUnless you have a direct connection to a breeder, shelter, or rescue organization, the first place you may want to look into finding your puppy is on the Internet. Nowadays, you’ll find direct sites for breeders, shelters, and other sources, as well as sites that review such businesses. And though it used to take time to contact other people who have had experiences with a shelter or breeder, you can now send instant messages to people to see how their puppies developed. The web has brought dog lovers together, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised to see how happy everyone is to help you get started on the right paw.",

You should meet with and talk directly to representatives of shelters and res- cue organizations or breeders. And do all the necessary research to find your forever puppy from a good source. Scammers are everywhere: Beware of the “breeder” who demands that you wire money immediately through Western Union. Puppy mills (facilities that basically farm dogs like livestock) advertise their litters online, misrepresenting their devotion to their puppies’ well-being. Welfare organizations and shelters post haunting photos of mixed-breed puppies who need homes but may not be a good fit for your home. A pet photo is like the cover of a book: You can’t tell much just by looking.\n\nSome websites rate potential breeders and list the ones who have litters for sale. Good places to go for information are www.adoptadog.com, www.puppyfinder. com, and www.puppyfind.com. However, some people in the puppy industry make the argument that no ethical breeders would sell puppies online because, much like a child-adoption agency, anyone with an ethical bone in their body would want to meet a prospective parent so that they know who is adopting their “furry children” and what kind of home they’ll be providing. So do your research carefully before traveling down this road. Anyone can advertise them- selves as a breeder, and you don’t want to give your heart away to a mishandled puppy!",

You will overpay for a puppy who has likely spent their early days in an outdoor pen or living on a puppy farm like a pig. You’ll be nearly guaranteed a puppy whose high levels of stress will play havoc on your lovely home or apartment. It’s far better to find either a rescue that has used a foster home or a breeder or shelter who’s helped your dog to adapt to life in your town and will be on call to help you to settle your puppy in as they start life with you.\n\nHere are some tips for finding a good pup on the Internet:\n\n» In addition to emailing the puppy’s shelter, owner, foster family, or breeder, speak to the other party by phone. Ask about the breeds and genetic health of the puppy’s parents, if they’re known. If the parent’s histories are supposedly known, but no one has health certifications to back that history up . . .think twice: Puppies are everywhere, and you want the one with a healthy future.\n\n» Ask for a copy of the puppy’s health records. People can easily and\n\nimmediately send them via text or email. If you’re even slightly suspicious about the information, call and speak to the veterinarian’s office directly. Ask the hospital staff questions about the puppy and the owner: Was the puppy raised with their mother and littermates, where were the puppies housed, and how much social interaction have they received? If the people caring for the puppy are unwilling to share this information, reconsider this puppy. The ideal puppy is one raised indoors with the birth family and with lots of loving social interaction — anything less may spell trouble for you in the long run. » When talking to people in contact with your puppy, listen for loaded",

Is the location clean? Does the puppy look happy and healthy?\n\n» If the puppy is already separated from their mother, ask what age they were at the time of separation. Puppies removed before 7 weeks lack their mother’s formative influence, which is invaluable for learning emotional regulation, bite inhibition, and respect. These puppies may never make up for the valuable time lost and may need a lot more structure and time to socialize and train.\n\n» Ask the owner to send you the purchaser’s contract outlining the\n\nagreement between you. Don’t buy a puppy without an agreement that clearly states what will happen to the puppy if you discover that they have a health issue or find that their temperament isn’t a good match for your family. If you’re unable to return the puppy for any reason, do not proceed. All good breeders should let you return their puppies, no questions asked.\n\n» If the breeder checks out and prefers that you pay online, use an online escrow account to hold the funds until your pup has arrived safely and you’ve had them checked out by your veterinarian. A reputable breeder should agree to this plan if they’re more devoted to the placement of their puppies than to their dollar value.\n\n» Beware of the bargain-basement puppy.

    "page_content": "When choosing a mixed-breed puppy from a photo, be mindful of the mix. Although all puppies look adorable onscreen, if the puppy is a combination of two breeds that you wouldn’t otherwise choose for your lifestyle, mixing them won’t help. Research all breeds that may be in the mix, and evaluate each one’s fit with your lifestyle.\n\nAdopting a pup from a shelter or a rescue organization\n\nYou may be wondering what the difference is between a shelter and a rescue orga- nization and how it relates to choosing your forever puppy. The short explanation is that shelters operate out of a municipal building or kennel-type facility and often care for a range of pets, whereas rescue organizations generally focus on one type of animal, and foster those animals out to live in homes until they are find their forever homes.\n\nAlthough puppies are generally born in litters ranging from 3 to 13 puppies, occa- sionally a mother dog gives birth to just one puppy, called a singleton. These pup- pies are at a disadvantage because they would normally learn much more about the world by way of interaction and play with their doggie siblings. Unless you’re a seasoned dog owner, avoid singleton puppies: These dogs need someone who can help them learn boundaries and good manners. The same advice applies to hand-raised puppies — puppies who, for whatever reason, lost their mothers early on and had to be rescued and raised solely by humans. Even if raised with litter- mates, without their mother’s influence and lessons on self-restraint these pup- pies often develop pushy, unyielding mannerisms and a tendency toward resource guarding. Explore other options and leave these puppies to someone with lots of special needs’ puppy-raising experience.",

Many shelters and animal welfare organizations rescue puppies from dire situations and care for them until they’re adopted. Some of these puppies are removed from their mothers at an early age (before 8 weeks old) and need special care before they can be put up for adoption. Other puppies are brought in with or without their mothers and left at a shelter. Those pre- adoption weeks are critical: If you adopt a puppy whose early life was stressed, you cannot make up for lost time. Even if you’re able to increase the socialization and touch conditioning levels in the first weeks you bring them home, there may be certain wary or dramatic reactions you can never completely condition out of your puppy.\n\nAs you surf the web, you may notice a lot of rescue organizations within a 1- or 2-hour drive from your home. Rescue organizations are similar to shelters in that they are not-for-profit, tax-exempt organizations. They differ from shelters because they generally focus on one species — say, dogs — and gather volunteers to serve as foster families until their rescues find their forever homes. Adopting a puppy from a rescue organization versus a shelter may be a longer process, involv- ing home visits and lengthy questioning to ensure that the rescue you like is best suited for you and your family (if you have one).",

If so, how far along are they with\n\n» What sort of stimulations have the puppies been exposed to (cats, kids, daily\n\n» If the puppy turns out not to be a good fit for your family, would the breeder\n\nA home breeder is unlikely to take the puppy back, so if the situation turns ugly, you may be left with the prospect of rehoming your puppy or dropping them off at a local shelter.\n\nBecause purebred puppies bred at home generally cost the same as a breeder would charge, give this option a second thought if this individual cannot provide health clearances or reassurances should this puppy not work out in your home.\n\nDon’t adopt a puppy younger than 8 weeks old. (Seven weeks may be okay only if you’re experienced with very young puppies.) You don’t want to adopt before 8 weeks because a pup’s mother normally spends weeks 6 through 8 socializing and teaching their puppies. The result of this socialization is good for you because the puppies will have more organized elimination habits, respect, and bite inhibition.",

During a developmental stage, when the puppy’s mother would be teaching respect and impulse control, a person is placating and inconsistent. In this case, everyone becomes a target for nipping and bullying behavior.\n\nAvoiding puppy brokers, puppy mills, and pet stores\n\nOkay — there are a few places where you should definitely not get a puppy. Here are my top five:\n\n» Puppy brokers or agents: Puppy brokers (also known as puppy agents) are smooth-talking dog people who will promise to get you a puppy from their list of top-of-the-line breeders. Initially, these folks seem like saviors, descending to save you from the hassle of locating a puppy on your own. Do not be fooled. Most brokers are just out to make a buck and fill orders as fast as they come in — but no decent breeder will ever sell their puppy through a third party. Puppy brokers will go who-knows-where to find you a puppy when you want it and mark up the puppies they find in order to lace their pockets. After you decide where you want to concentrate your search, finding a puppy on your own isn’t hard; Chapter 3 and this chapter walk you through the process.\n\nIf you’ve already paid a broker to find you a puppy, insist on speaking to the breeder, ask the broker to provide reviews from other customers, and check the health clearances on both parents.\n\n» Puppy mill breeders: Puppy mill breeders aren’t breeders; they’re farmers.",

Mother dogs are often bred every heat cycle (a horrific practice) and then killed off after they can no long produce large litters. Puppies are produced under tremendous stress and often live to wallow in feces. The noise of the dog’s barking is deafening. Individual puppies have little socialization or handling before they’re washed and primed for sale. Buying a puppy from this sort of situation does nothing but feed this practice. Do you want your money to go to someone who has such little regard for a dog’s life? Puppies from these situations are often more difficult to housetrain, chew to relieve anxiety that started long before you brought them home, and\n\nare hypersensitive to touch and sound. Sometimes it’s hard to determine if your puppy came from a puppy mill, but generally if you are buying your puppy from a middleman it’s highly likely that seller bought the puppy wholesale from a puppy mill where puppies are sold cheaply and not from a breeder who would never dream of selling their pups to a middleman.\n\n» From a box on the corner: If you ever pass a box with a sign that reads “Free to good home” or any similar message, promise me that you won’t look. Puppies are a mix of their parent’s genes and their early upbringing. In this case, you’ll likely have no proof of either. I have two words for you: Walk away.

A reputable breeder would never sell puppies to a pet store. So the pet store then contacts resale breeders who often breed many dogs simultaneously to meet the demands of the pet store. The resale breeders often stretch both themselves and their breeding dogs to the limit, and many of the facilities called — you guessed it — puppy mills (see the preceding bullet point) are understaffed. These conditions result in puppies who don’t get proper care or socialization with the human world. They may also be sickly, as puppy mills are notorious for being understaffed, resulting in filth, dirty unchanged water, and feces-encrusted cages that attract parasites and flies. Bacteria and illness frequent these environments and quickly spread from puppy to puppy. Why take the risk?\n\n» Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter: Although I’m not saying a breeder won’t have an online presence, online interactions don’t take the place of reaching out and speaking with the breeder, shelter, or rescue organization. If you want to begin your search online, explore sites like www.petfinder.com to locate rescue dogs or www.akc.org to locate breeders. After you’ve researched places and checked their reviews, and perhaps even reached out to some of their puppy owners on Facebook, it’s time to make the phone call and speak to the people in charge. Take the time now to research this project. Otherwise, you may have more than a decade to regret your impulsivity — and that’s one hard lesson to swallow.",

Generally, when you pay for a puppy, you’re paying for genera- tions of careful breeding and reliable temperament. A breeder who is generating mixed- breed puppies, giving them names like Chi-weenie and Shorkie and selling them at a premium, may well be someone who owns a puppy mill and is just pairing dogs they have housed in kennels.

If visiting a breeder, ask if you can meet the parents and spend a couple of hours observing the litter. Like all kids, all puppies have distinct personalities and varying degrees of sensory awareness. A puppy with a strong sense of themselves is forceful in play and with toys; a more passive puppy hesitates in new situations and often watches and considers before they jump up and responds. A playful puppy gets excited more easily and tries to engage their littermates in interactive activities like wrestling and tug-of-war. When choosing your new puppy, watch how they interact with their first family — that’s how they relate to their world.\n\nBefore you drive to a breeder, ask about the visiting procedures: Can you meet individual puppies on your own, or will you be in an open room with the breeder present?

Ask to visit in the morning or late afternoon because that’s when most puppies are awake and playful. If that isn’t possible, ask about the puppy’s schedule and how long you can stay. Avoid nap times or late-night visits. When possible, ask to stay for a couple of hours so that you can watch and interact with the litter over an extended period.\n\n» At a shelter: Speak with a staff member ahead of time to find out how many puppies are available for adoption. (You can also ask ahead of time whether they know the breeds or mix of breeds so that you know whether the type of dog you want is available.) Find out whether a private meeting area is available and whether you can observe a litter together. Ideally, you want to see your candidate interacting with other puppies to determine their sociabil- ity within a group.\n\n» At a pet shop: If you’ve settled on purchasing your puppy from a pet store, you’ll visit on your schedule. When possible, visit in the morning after the puppies have had a good rest. Ask to meet individual puppies separately: If one seems like a good fit, bring other puppies into the greeting room, too, to see how your candidate interacts with them.",

Though you can shape your puppy’s habits once you get them home — redirecting your playful puppy if they jump on you, for example, or having them learn to fetch a toy when you come home — their worldview is set early on. In this section, I tell you how to evaluate a pup’s personality based on simple exercises and on watching how they act with their littermates. These are basic categories — a litter may have more than one, or may not have one, of the personality types:\n\n» Assertive: Assertive and playful puppies have a lot in common, so it’s easy to confuse the two. At first glance, both might seem social and interactive. You may think, “Wow — that one has spirit.” However, keep watching. Do they steal the toys from the other puppies or play too rough? Do they scale the enclosure or climb on the backs of their littermates as though they don’t exist?\n\nThese bossy behaviors are sure signs of determination, smarts, and willpower, but unless you’re in the market for a dog who’ll win agility competitions, think hard about how those characteristics will mesh with your home life. If you have the time to channel (and challenge) this puppy, take them home.\n\nHowever, if you have other demands on your time and you’re hoping for a puppy to reduce your stress, another personality type may suit you better. » Playful: Puppies in this group are quick-thinking, fun-loving, and engaging.",

When playing with different puppies, they adjust their tempo to reflect the other puppies’ demeanor. Another term for this personality type is social butterflies because they’re all about engaging without being too headstrong. This temperament is ideal for an active person or a family with older children.\n\n» Independent: These puppies interact in playful encounters some of the\n\ntime, but are also happy sitting or playing with a toy on their own. Stoic and contained, these independent thinkers seem to have been born with an old soul.\n\nThese pups are ideal in structured homes where owners fully respect their sense of self and make a commitment to teach them. Because these puppies are mindful and alert, they’re best suited to calm homes with older kids or no children.\n\nDependent: This type loathes solitude and wants to please. If socialized with people, they gravitate to you as if seeking your approval. That attitude leads this puppy to the head of the class or into the doghouse, depending on how you play it: If you direct and reinforce good manners, you’ll have more than 100 percent cooperation; but if you try to discipline your puppy, they’ll see your interaction as a reason to replay bad behavior over and over and over.\n\nBecause of their trainability, dependent puppies are wonderful companions, but they can end up on the B list if they don’t receive direction.\n\n» Relaxed: This calm personality type beautifully balances play, interaction, and sleep — doing all three on their own time.

These pups are also passive and eager to please, so their sweetness is palpable. Within their litters, these puppies stay close to their mothers and use their protection as a shield.\n\nThe sweet personality is good for owners who prefer doting attention over rigorous training.

When approached, they often creep on their bellies or arch their backs in total submission.\n\nYour heart may go out to pups with this personality, but select this type only if you have the time and patience to devote to fostering their self-esteem.\n\nRegardless of your effort, timid puppies may always be overwhelmed and in need of direction, so they aren’t a suitable choice for families with children.",

An N puppy may lick or place their mouth on you gently, whereas a P puppy will show concern.\n\nWhen choosing a puppy for a home with young children, I look for a puppy who has a very low sensitivity to touch — one who barely notices a toe squeeze and doesn’t ruffle at being petted the wrong way or restrained for a short burst of time (fewer than 5 seconds).\n\nWhen your prospective puppy least expects it, tap two metal spoons together behind their back, then drop them 3 inches from where they’re standing. Gauge their reaction: Do they startle and freeze? How quickly do they recover to explore the spoons or take a treat from your hand? If the puppy shows intense spoon interest, score A; a nonchalant glance, an N; and a fear reaction noted by cowering or withdrawal, a P.\n\nStand and wait until the puppy is no longer interested in you. Suddenly fall to the ground and exclaim “Ouch!” Does the puppy race over and pounce (A), come to sniff or lick your face (N), or cower and run in fear (P)?\n\nIf you have a family, choose a puppy who rolls with unpredicted reactions and noise. You have enough on your hands without your puppy getting involved.\n\nLift the puppy 4 inches off the floor by cradling their midsection. Hold them there for at least 5 seconds. Do they wriggle and bite furiously (A)? Do they relax and look around (N)? Do they look fearful and constrict their body posture (P)?",

Don’t be surprised if you get mixed results. Here are some tips for interpreting the tallied score:\n\n» All A: This interactive puppy is bright and self-assured. Raising them will take concentration, consistency, and time. Their favorite expression: “What’s next?”\n\n» All N: Easygoing and contained, this puppy will be pleasant and self-assured, though perhaps not motivated to follow your agenda when it conflicts with their own. Their favorite expression: “Is this necessary?”\n\n» All P: This puppy has weak self-esteem and needs your reassurance to feel safe. Without proper lessons and socialization, they’ll be shy. Their favorite expression: “It’s been three minutes — do you still love me?”\n\n» Mix of A and N: This active puppy will want to be in the middle of everything but will show slightly more impulse control when stimulated. Their favorite expression: “Let’s do it again!”\n\n» Mix of N and P: This puppy will be easygoing and gentle, yet with a stronger sense of self than a completely passive pup. Because they’re more composed, they’ll be an ideal puppy for a calm house with or without older children. Favorite expression: “Another back-scratching, please.”",

I’ve been there — finding the right puppy is worth the wait.\n\nIf you’ve decided to adopt an older puppy, you may be hoping to skip the tasks involved with the younger set, from curbing the nipping habit to house-training. With the right pup, you may be able to avoid some of these situations. However, no situation is perfect, and very few puppies can glide into a new life without a few setbacks. In this section, I walk you through some of the special considerations you should have when picking out an older puppy.\n\nDepending on where you go to look for an older puppy, read the following ques- tions to ask and points to consider before taking your little guy or gal home:\n\n» Breeder: A breeder often keeps a puppy for showing purposes. If the puppy doesn’t grow into “show dog” potential, they’ll be made available for sale. Sometimes, finding this puppy is like hitting the jackpot — provided the puppy has been living indoors, has received individual attention, and has been well socialized. At other times, it’s a disappointment, especially if the puppy has lived in a kennel for the past 6 months.",

    "page_content": "Because a breeder’s older puppy may be unfamiliar with the routines of home life, they may not know what stairs are or may not have spent time in a yard. And, no matter what the breeder tries to tell you, a puppy who has spent the majority of their time in a kennel isn’t housebroken. Find out where this puppy spent their early months before racing into this venture. A puppy who can’t emotionally acclimate to your home life isn’t a reasonable candidate for you. » Rescue organizations: Rescue organizations foster their puppies in homes, and you’ll be able to both visit the home and question the foster parent about your puppy’s socialization, temperament, and training. This can be a good option when considering an older puppy. The same rules apply, however, to the important question to ask: Has the puppy been raised indoors around other pets and people? How are their reactions to everyday sounds and stimulations? How is their house-training going? Don’t be afraid to ask or test for more detailed information, like whether the puppy enjoys snuggling or being held, what toys are their favorites, whether you can remove high-value items like a bone or food dish, and how they behave on a leash. If you have a family, make sure the puppy relates to everyone, including other pets.\n\nYou may find a puppy, young or old, who is being fostered in another state. Visit if you can; otherwise, look for a different puppy. People who are fostering are in the business of getting their puppies adopted, and they want to do it especially quickly if a puppy is a lot to handle. Sometimes, these people may enhance a dog’s behavior traits and disregard others. See Table 4-1 for alternative interpretations of general behavioral descriptions. Buyer beware.",

Provide plenty of satisfying options or else you may see your sofa disappear, one cushion at a time.\n\n» Shelter: If you find an older puppy at a shelter, ask about their history and try to find out why they were left there. Were they found on the side of the street, or have they grown up in the system? Has the puppy in question been returned more than once? Ask what the reasons were — you may be adopting a dog who couldn’t be house-trained, was fearful of kids, or showed aggression when chewing a bone. Find out what the staff thinks of the puppy’s personality. » Pet store, puppy broker, craigslist, and other sources: Discount shopping isn’t for puppies. Do not buy a puppy without meeting and talking to the breeder or rescuers first. Though you may read a phrase that makes you feel like you’ll be the winner, there are no winners in the online puppy shopping game. Buying a puppy in this manner ensures that more puppies will be bred this way, which doesn’t take their interests to heart.",

Always remember to let your head lead your heart. Nothing is sadder than rescuing a dog only to have to return them because they couldn’t cope with your lifestyle. Be strong — find out ahead of time whether you and the puppy are suited to each other by performing the following tasks:\n\n» If you have kids, introduce them to the puppy before you bring\n\n» If you have an animal menagerie at home, make sure the puppy can cope with the creature chaos. Ask whether the owner has other pets at home (if the puppy has been living there) or whether anyone has conditioned this puppy to other creatures.\n\n» Ask a staff member (or the previous owner) to lift the puppy.

Initially, your puppy will need only a few simple items, such as bowls, some toys, and a crate, gate, or pen for an enclosure. This chapter can help you make the right choices about purchasing puppy supplies, from what kind of toys and self-soothing objects to buy to where to place the crate. A little planning will give you peace of mind and ensure that your puppy comes home to a calm, consistent, and supportive new environment.\n\nThe first few days after you bring your puppy home will be a bit of a blur; the most important task to focus on is your puppy’s sleeping and house-training routines. Quick responses to commands like Sit and Come are important (and you’ll learn about early puppy conditioning in Chapter 7), but your initial focus is on helping your puppy adapt to your schedule and getting comfortable living with you.\n\nTo avoid overstimulating your puppy or blowing your budget before the puppy has cut their baby teeth, remember that less is more, at least initially. Though you may have the temptation to buy everything you can for your pup — from the latest toy to a designer raincoat — I suggest that you bring a list and stick to it.",

Think of it less as a cage and more as a bedroom.

Big mistake. Big rooms make a puppy feel displaced and lonely so that they may potty or chew out of sheer anxiety. Dogs are den animals who feel safest in small, manageable spaces.

The Snuggle Puppy, for example, comes equipped with a heartbeat and hot water bottle to radiate the feeling of sleeping with other puppies.\n\n» Prepare a docking station or CD player to play music when your puppy is left alone. Dogs don’t like silence in general and may grow anxious of distant noises they can’t explore. The point of music is to drown out the sounds of silence and help your puppy tolerate on being alone.\n\n» Install light-blocking binds to create a den-like atmosphere at night\n\n» Provide a pacifier equivalent. Hollowed-out toys stuffed with kibbles\n\n» Induce calm and sleeping by adding a crate cover. The first goal with quiet time is to teach your puppy how to relax and soothe themselves when no one can be with them.\n\nFor the first weeks after you have your puppy home, help them pattern sleep rou- tines.

It can be emotionally destructive to your puppy if it’s overused, because puppies are social creatures and aren’t accus- tomed to long spells of isolation. Left alone regularly for more than 4 to 6 hours often results in hyperisolation anxiety — a lonely puppy who’s overreactive and hyper, in other words. If you must leave your puppy for long stretches, consider a playpen-crate combination.\n\nA crate isn’t a teaching tool. Your puppy needs lessons from you to learn how to act in all areas of your home and in everyday situations, such as mealtimes and family interactions and when people come to visit.\n\nIf the idea of a crate still turns your stomach, you have other options. To contain your puppy when you’re not home (necessary for house-training and to teach your puppy to rest when you’re not home), you can use a playpen or a very small, gated room. If your puppy is older, you can use a leash to keep your puppy with you when you’re home and show them how to act in the rooms you share.\n\nThough playpens are ideal enclosures for young puppies under 12 weeks of age, and can be used to supervise a puppy in multiple areas of a home, they begin to lose their magic when your puppy reaches 4 months of age. At this time your puppy won’t want to be separated from you, and the use of a playpen may lead to excessive barking or frustration chewing. Hopefully, by this time you’ll have a handle on house-training and can begin to give your puppy more freedom in supervised areas.",

The issue with feeding your puppy at a set hour and all at once is that they will grow restless and excited near their designated mealtime and then be rewarded with a big jack- pot of food for annoying behavior. Instead, consider feeding your puppy their daily ration of food throughout the morning or late afternoon, using the food to reward their attention and patience. I tell you more about early puppy training and socialization in Chapter 9.",

    "page_content": "Doggie mealtime is a purely human concept. Yes, it’s more convenient to feed your puppy in a bowl, but when you’re able, portion out meals into reward pockets or treat cups and use the food to motivate good habits, such as coming when called, chewing toys on their mat, or pottying in the proper place.\n\nFor now, purchase a few bowls to start — two for water and one to contain your puppy’s meals. Keep bowls for water inside the house and out, but sequester your puppy’s food dish to control and vary feeding locations based on your early social- ization efforts. For example, you may choose to feed them on their comfort mat one day, saying “On your mat” as you lead them there; in their crate the next day, saying “In your room”; and in the car another day, saying “To the car.” Meals are powerful motivators and are useful in conditioning and socializing your puppy during the first month you spend together.\n\nAs for the type of bowl, stainless steel is ideal because it’s easy to clean, it doesn’t break, and its weight reduces the chance of the bowl being knocked over. Size the bowl to your puppy’s breed: small, medium, or large.\n\nYou can buy bowls with stands that raise the dish to make eating more ergonomi- cally comfortable and that are advertised to help prevent bloat (which they do not). These bowls certainly make eating look more comfortable, but they aren’t totally necessary, because dogs are physically designed to be ground-level feeders.\n\nBloat is a fairly common and fatal dog disease if not caught immediately. Caused by gas, the stomach presses on the diaphragm and twists, cutting off all circula- tion. Learn about the signs and symptoms and avoid the number-one cause of bloat — exercise directly after eating a large meal.",

Modern convenience is lost on some dogs, who still like to interact with their food instead of gobbling it up in one sitting.\n\nYour puppy will repeat behaviors that get your attention, food, and fun. The sim- plest way to motivate your young puppy’s good manners and routines is to reward positive choices — sitting for attention, for example, or standing on all four paws instead of jumping. In addition, if you praise, pat, or play with your puppy each time they make a good chewing choice, you’ll save yourself a lot of destruction in the long run. The following sections present other tips to get your new puppy started on the road to good behavior from the moment you adopt them.\n\nA food reward is often the best way to encourage your puppy’s focus and make a positive association with learning. If your puppy’s excited for the dry food you’ve chosen to feed them, look no further. Ration out all or a portion of each meal, and divide that amount into treat cups or reward pockets (as described in the following list).\n\nIf you feed your puppy moist or raw food or they don’t excite to their kibble, find another type of treat that gets them excited. Remember that your enthusiasm with the treat is more important than the amount or size of the food reward. Here are two great ways to use food to train and motivate your puppy’s earliest learning:",

(I discuss this training technique in Chapter 10.) To create a treat cup for your puppy, purchase an inexpensive plastic container (or use an emptied deli container), cut a small, round hole in the lid, and fill it halfway with dried kibbles or broken-up dog treats.\n\n» Reward pockets: Place your puppy’s treats in one of your pockets or\n\npurchase a food pouch to stow snacks. With food bits at the ready, indoors and out, teach and reward your puppy whenever the opportunity knocks. Did they sit before you opened the door or go to their mat or crate — reward them as you say “Good puppy!” Are they nervous going down the stairs? A few tidbits tossed on the ground may be all the incentive they need to try a little harder. Use meals or treats for rewarding your puppy for returning to you and for outdoor pottying. Check out Chapter 10 for more uses of reward pockets.\n\nAlthough you may be tempted to buy every toy and bone available to you, don’t! Puppies, like children, have specific likes and dislikes, and overwhelming your pup with options is disruptive. They’ll grow up thinking everything on the floor is fair game — even your beloved, oh-so-broken-in slippers.

Puppies learn from mimicking,\n\nand nothing is more fun than discovering food and rewards locked inside a stuffed bone.

Choose a couple of toys to discover what captures your puppy’s heart, and look no further.\n\nStuffed toys can be great fun for puppies who think of them as small prey animals, especially when they squeak. Some puppies, however, go beyond the toss- and-play mode and insist on ripping them from limb from limb until the squeaker is removed. This isn’t an ideal game for puppies, because squeakers can be dan- gerous when you remove them, and the stuffing can be ingested. Search for toys with the word indestructible on the packaging.",

When giving your puppy freedom outside, use a 25- to 50-foot-long lead to allow them freedom to play while giving you plenty of leash to interfere with a rambunctious puppy and/or hold onto to retrieve them if they should wander off. For young puppies, long lines are great for wandering in a yard or field — take along some favorite snacks and reward your puppy every time they “check in” with you. You can also use long lines to encourage off-lead training as your puppy matures.\n\nI discuss training leashes used on older puppies in the section “Exploring Future Needs, Modern Gadgets, and Training Tools,” later in this chapter.

A sling rides over your shoulder and allows you to tuck your puppy into the pouch when they’re in a calm mood so that you can keep your puppy close when conditioning them to new sights and sounds or when moving about your home or building. To accustom your puppy to the sling, lay it flat in or near their sleeping area and hide food in the folds, so they can smell, explore, and find treasure in it. To familiarize them with your smell, put a shirt in the pouch, too.\n\nMost puppies are transitioning from full-time companionship with littermates to a singleton lifestyle in your home. Though you don’t want to carry them about full time, lest they develop an overdependence on your presence, using a sling to con- dition them to your lifestyle and to socialize them in the world beyond can be as reassuring as it is convenient.\n\nIf you have other pets agitated by seeing a newbie having so much direct contact, make a different selection from the products in the following sections.\n\nSmall travel kennels, especially if you plan to travel with your adult dog, should be conditioned early and used to provide your puppy with a feeling of safety. Condi- tion your puppy to their carrier by sprinkling food, treats, and toys around them in the carrier. If your puppy is wary, you may also unzip the openings and play in and around it.\n\nThe sooner you get started with the carrier, the faster your puppy will grow to accept that being in it means more time with you.

Imagine being led about by a necklace: you’d pull away and feel trapped, too (a phenomenon known as oppositional reflex). Unless you’re a pro with leash training and you have your timing down to a science, consider using compassion wear, which conditions your puppy to walk near you through a system of guiding, not jerking or pulling. These user-friendly collars require little to no strength to control and allow you to focus on positive reinforcement to encourage your puppy’s focus and cooperation. The two types of conditioning collars are no-pull harnesses and head collars.\n\nYou can reference my website, SarahSaysPets.com, for photos and video clips specifying leash use and collar options.\n\nStick to buckle collars and freedom lines when guiding puppies younger than 4 months old. Other types of collars restrict your puppy’s breathing and teach them that walking near you is uncomfortable.\n\nI’ve found a few types of no-pull harness designs that are effective in encouraging good following skills in puppies.

This communicated the statement, “Hey, wild one, settle down!” The head collar has the same effect. Left on during play, the pressure on the nose discourages rowdiness and mouthing. By placing a short lead on your puppy when you’re expecting company, you can effectively curb jumping habits. Barking frenzies are drastically reduced, and training is made simple as you guide your puppy from one exercise to the next. Another plus is that leading by the chin demands minimal physical strength, so nearly everyone can use it — kids too.

If yours is relatively well behaved, you can use it exclusively during walks and lessons. If they’re the mouthing, jumping, or barking type, leave the collar on whenever you’re able to supervise them.\n\nThe head collar must fit properly around your puppy’s neck. If it’s too loose, your puppy can pull it off and perhaps chew it. You want the neck strap to fit snuggly, with one finger’s worth of space between the neck and the strap. (My website, SarahSaysPets.com, offers a short video on sizing the head collar and putting it on.)",

Their reaction reminds me of the first day my mother dressed me in lace — I hated it, but after an hour or so, I hardly noticed it at all. And your puppy will learn to tolerate the head collar. When you see them flopping about like a flounder, be patient. After they realize that they\n\ncan’t remove the collar, they’ll forget about it. Some puppies take an hour to adjust to the feel of the collar; some take a day or two. Place it on their head three times a day for 20-minute intervals until they accept it.\n\nNeck wear collars, also known as choke or prong collars, are available but not rec- ommended for modern-day dogs and dog lovers. The idea behind a neck wear collar is that it applies pressure around the dog’s neck when the dog strays, bolts, or chooses to explore in another direction. This causes a feeling of entrapment or worse, affixation, which leaves a dog feeling more stressed by situations like seeing another dog or walking with you. Long term? Neck collars do more harm than good.\n\nIf you’re confident that you can guide your puppy by their neck, choose a check chain or martingale collar. This collar slides over your puppy’s head and rests high on the neck, just behind their ears. The check chain has a section of chain that should be centered between your puppy’s ears. The martingale is a cloth collar that is especially useful with long-necked dog breeds because it has a wide midsection that distributes the weight of your pull.",

When out walking with their dogs, humans tend to go in straight lines, confident in the belief that they are in charge because they are holding the leash. But restricted, linear walks are unnatural to puppies, who prefer to meander and explore. Your puppy will pull on the leash in an effort to increase the meandering. You will pull back, increasing the restricting. This combination of pulling away and pulling back puts pressure on your puppy’s collar, and they’ll start to choke and feel very, very anxious.\n\nWalks should bring about the calm you experience when walking hand in hand with someone you care deeply about. It’s a learned habit: Getting it right takes some practice and the right leash and training restraint. The following sections have some tips about finding the right equipment; be sure to review the earlier section on freedom lines and the joy your puppy feels when exploring naturally.\n\nAs your puppy matures, they’ll be less tolerant of being left alone. If they’re still too curious to turn loose in your home, it’s time to begin leash training. (Flip to Chapter 7 for specific instructions.) After your puppy is comfortable on a leash, guide them room by room using a 4- to 6-foot leash that you can hold or clip to your side.",

Vary between the freedom line and the training leash so that your puppy learns to understand the difference by the weight of the leash.\n\nWhen practicing your puppy’s walking skills on a training leash, stop whenever your puppy pulls and wait until they turn or walk back to you or sits to begin walking again. If your puppy does circle back to your side, drop a treat inches from your shoes and say “Find it” to reinforce the decision to check in.\n\nWhen driving a little puppy under 16 weeks old in a car, use a small crate to encourage calm manners and for safety purposes. As the puppy matures, continue leading them to one door and area of your car; if crating a large dog as you drive isn’t feasible, consider using a safety harness and/or seat belt attachment when you drive.\n\nA seat belt safety lead can be used in the car or left secured to your puppy’s collar for easy guidance when you’re out and about.

Anything that encourages your puppy to repeat activities like pottying in the right place, chew- ing on their toys instead of yours, or going to their mat is a good thing.\n\nIf you’ve never formally been introduced to the clicker, allow me: This small, handheld device (see Figure 5-4) makes a sharp clicking sound each time it’s pressed. Pair this sound with a food reward and you’ll discover power that would make Pavlov proud. Your puppy will alert to the sound, and when they connect this noise with a food reward, they’ll be prompted to repeat whatever action makes it click. Use the clicker properly to condition good behavior in mere sec- onds. Sounds too good to be true, right? It isn’t, and you can get started with pup- pies of any age. Check out Chapter 11 for more tips on how to use your clicker to help your puppy use good habits.",

It wasn’t until the mid- to-late 1900s that a scientist named David Mech, trudging into various Northern reaches of the United States, revealed the truth about how wolves live and relate to each other. Funny thing — wolves have strong family ties and devotion to their young that’s not so different from how humans live and love.\n\nAs far as the evolutionary debate and how it relates to your relationship to your puppy goes, suffice it to say that dogs are no longer considered domesticated wolves, but rather a subspecies that split off to form a friendlier, more pleasing species that continues in their eagerness to please us. Imagine that! Brian Hare, a researcher from Duke University, wrote a compelling essay stating that, with both dogs and people, our survival was less survival of the fittest (as another great naturalist, Charles Darwin, proposed) than survival of the friendliest, because we required group cooperation to thrive.",

In 2008, he did what at the time seemed like a simple comparative analysis showing beyond a reasonable doubt that dogs have similar cognitive abilities to 2-2½-year-old children. Researching at the University of British Columbia, Coren set out to determine which breed of dog was the smartest based on a set of questions that tested their responsiveness to human direction. Although the findings caused quite the ripple in the dog world, the significant undisputable discovery was that all dogs, regard- less of their breed or intelligence rating, are capable of processing information, reasoning linear outcomes involving getting something they desired (such as a bone or freedom), and deducing simple arithmetic. He also showed that dogs could learn up to 150 words.\n\nDr. Coren’s publications opened the floodgates, and soon studies from around the world were conducted on topics including a dog’s musical preferences to similarities in the body chemicals released during petting.\n\nFast-forward to 2012 when another human neuroscientist, named Gregory Berns, an MD/PhD who specialized in MRI analysis, did a similar experiment with dogs. By tracking their brains’ responses to familiar smells, sights, and verbal directions, he discovered beyond a reasonable doubt that dogs show similar proactive and excited reactivity to everyday routines and people as we do.",

Here are some other points Horowitz makes:\n\n» In a side-by-side analysis, your adult puppy will have up to 300 million olfactory\n\ncells (your puppy’s sniffing receptors) in their head, in comparison to a human’s 6 million — that’s a 50:1 ratio.\n\n» If trained, a dog can identify a single teaspoon of sugar in 2 million gallons of water — that’s two Olympic-size pools of water. I can’t even smell sugar in my morning coffee.\n\n» Every dog has a secondary olfactory center located in the roof of their mouth, called the vomeronasal organ, that alerts them to slight changes in body chemicals (known as pheromones) that help to distinguish the age, sex, and sexual receptivity of other dogs.\n\n» Dogs can smell moods. Slight changes in our perspiration cue our dogs into\n\nSure, dogs aren’t smart like people are, but it’s precisely because they are not people that dogs are brilliant in their own right, and the sooner you can recognize, respect, and reward your puppy for their version of clever, the sooner you’ll be navigating your own love story.\n\nWhen walking your puppy, allow some time for sniffing — especially in areas where dogs congregate. Sure, the idea that your dog is sniffing other dogs’ elimi- nations sounds gross to you, but you’re not a dog. To your puppy, reading the morning “pee-mail” is the highlight of their day.",

He discovered that all mammals (humans, too) are born with five master emotions that rule all their behavior, day in and day out. I’ll relate the five emotions to dogs only, but don’t be afraid to let your imagination run wild — we have more in common with our dogs’ emotional landscape than you might think.\n\nSeeking is the master emotion that drives a dog’s survival: They hunt to find food, water, and companionship. As a social creature, your puppy can’t survive on their own and will form close bonds to whoever they spend time with, which often sur- pass their connection with other, unfamiliar dogs.\n\nScientists have recorded 100 expressions that dogs use to communicate with people. Many of these expressions are easy to identify: I want some, play with me, pet me now, time for breakfast, let’s go for a walk! See how many expressions you can read — you know your puppy best.\n\nPlay is somewhat of a mystery: No one can put their finger on why it happens — it just does. Dogs play when they feel safe where they are and who they are with: It’s a good measure of your puppy’s mood.\n\nPlaying and seeking are baseline emotions that you can use to measure your puppy’s mood accurately. When taking your puppy out and about or introducing a new distraction in your home, if your puppy will take a treat or engage with a toy, rest assured that they’re feeling secure enough to access their positive emotions.",

In the next section on body language, you’ll learn the telltale signs of fear, but you don’t have to imagine too deeply — fear is a universal feeling. It freezes joy and leaves dogs immobilized, not sure of what will happen next and unsure what exactly to do about it.\n\nI address a puppy’s fearful reactions throughout the rest of this book. Pay close attention to Chapter 9: Socialization is the best insurance that your puppy is com- fortable with all the sights and sounds he’ll experience in your world: Otherwise, you’ll never know when fear-of-the-unknown might strike.\n\nFrustration hits when a puppy is caught between what they want to do and what they can’t do — or what they can’t reach. Low-level frustration often happens when a toy rolls under the couch or when a puppy whines behind a gate. Higher- level frustration mounts and may develop into more dramatic reactions in\n\nresponse to people passing by a window or fenced yard or to suffering from exces- sive isolation. You can find tips for dealing with these specific issues in Part 5.\n\nPanic is fear on steroids. Puppies panic when imminent death or peril seems at hand: It can happen in the early weeks of life when a puppy is separated from her litter, or at some point later on. I once worked with a husky who was crated during a small house fire, while the alarms blared and fire crews arrived to douse the blaze; after that experience, that pup panicked every time he was asked to go into a crate. Panic shuts down all other emotions and leaves a puppy in a state of, well, panic.",

His books outlined dogs’ emotional lives and communication styles. When it comes to communicating, dogs and humans differ in these key aspects:\n\n» People talk with language and need to listen to one another for meaning. » Dogs use postures and subtle gestures to symbolize meaning: If you want to\n\nhear what your dog is saying, you need to use your eyes.\n\nIt took nearly two decades for scientists to follow Dr. Dodman’s lead, but when they did, they confirmed roughly everything he’d already taught us. Here’s an overview of your dog’s body talk: Consider how learning how to listen to your puppy will improve your relationship. Puppies are like kids — they are much more eager to listen to you if you learn to listen to their side of the story, too.\n\nYour puppy’s posture is a funny thing: It’s easier to remember if you compare it to yourself or someone you know well. Both pups and people “shrink” when they’re confused, fearful, or anxious; they also rise with excitement. They have a\n\nresting pose when life is least stressful, and a few favorite sleeping poses. Observe your pup and note, down to the very last detail, their body language, paying spe- cial attention to tail and ear positions.",

If you, in your desperation to save face, start shouting and pushing your puppy as someone enters, the whole arrival scene is one big fiasco. Instead of redirecting your puppy or showing calmness by example, you’ve just taught your puppy that greetings are a wild-’n’-crazy scene.\n\nLearn to translate your puppy’s postures and to redirect or soothe them when the mood they show doesn’t reflect the scene. In the remainder of this chapter you’ll also learn how their ears, eyes, mouth, tail, mouth, and vocalizations can be interpreted — use Figure 6-1 and Table 6-1 for quick reference.

Learn how you can interpret your puppy’s five key expressions to help adjust to eye situations:\n\n» Relaxed eyes: Notice your puppy’s eyes when you’re enjoying a moment together. Comfortably gazing at you in calm and mutual adoration, pupils (that dark circle in the center of their eye) in proportion to the colored ring, AKA the iris? That’s their relaxed eye.\n\n» Squinty, appeasing eyes: If your puppy is squinty it means one of three\n\nthings — they are trying to appease you (or another person or dog), they are slightly fearful (you can tell if they’re rump is lowered), or there is something actually caught in their eye. (Not usual, but if they scratch or rub their eye, you should check.)\n\n» Hard eyes: A dog who stares with hard eyes and a rigid body is feeling threatened or defensive. If pressed this dog — or puppy — will bite. » Whale-eye: This happens, and is not a good thing, when a puppy is so stressed, frustrated, or anxious by a stimulus or situation that you can actually see the whites of their eyes. If this happens to your puppy, do whatever you can to calm them by removing the stimulus or taking them out of the situation.\n\n» Avoids eye contact: If your puppy avoids your eye contact, they are either feeling overwhelmed by your interactions (are you staring down at them intensely?) or are just trying to ignore you altogether (not an uncommon behavior when they are in their adolescent phase — see Chapter 12!). If you can’t tell right off the bat, check out their other indicators (ears and tail, in other words) to see if they are up (attitude) or down (conflicted).",

As you’ll discover, there’s more to a tail wag than what meets the eye: Its position as well as the tempo of the wag deter- mine whether your puppy is happy or anxious or feeling more assertive.\n\nTo get a read on your puppy’s tail, observe its position. First, figure out their neu- tral tail — where it sits in relationship to their rump when they’re calm. Using that position as tail-neutral, see whether you can identify these “tell-tail” emotions:\n\n» Happy: Your puppy will lift their tail slightly and wag it from side to side when\n\n» Excited: When your puppy is excited, they will raise their tail a bit more and\n\nwags more frantically; this often happens when you return home.\n\n» Arched: A puppy who feels threatened (generally a behavior not seen before 7 months of age) may arch their tail stiffly over their rump. This puppy will stand their ground! Proceed with caution!\n\n» Tucked: A puppy who tucks their tail beneath their body is trying to look\n\nsmall. Often accompanied by cowering, this one is signaling fear or anxiety.\n\nYour puppy’s tail wag doesn’t always signal joy. Learn these tempos so that you can distinguish a happy wag from an anxious or aggressive wag:\n\n» Happy swing: Puppies who wag their tails so hard that their bodies wiggle are extremely happy: Discover what makes your puppy feel this good — maybe a special treat, toy, or happy voice — and use these things to train and reward your pup as often as possible.",

If the tail is swaying at rump level, your puppy is showing submissiveness. A below-rump sway on a puppy displays fear.\n\n» Twitch: Twitching tails convey intense emotion. One that’s raised above the\n\nrump signals agitation. A low twitch? This puppy is panicking.\n\nWant to know just what your puppy thinks about Aunt Edna’s visit? Look at their tail — if it’s wagging on the right side, they’re happy. Tails that wag to the left communicate caution or insecurity.\n\nYour puppy will also use their ears to express emotion and will often use them in concert with their tail: Ears and tail up convey confidence and a bold curiosity; ears and tail lowered communicate caution or fear. Learn these poses and all the other ear expressions in between these two extremes.\n\n» Relaxed: All puppies have different ears. Some flop, others point, and some stand part way up. Study the ears when your puppy is relaxed to determine their resting pose.\n\n» Seal-like: This adorable, seal-like look is copped when your puppy draws their ears back: When it’s paired with a full swing of their tail, you no doubt have a happy and excited puppy on your hands.\n\n» Antenna: This is the classic one-up, one-down expression that lets you know your puppy is focusing on two different noises at the same time.

A closed mouth is common when a dog is sleeping or playing independently. A tightened lip pout is seen in puppies who are concentrating or doing something unpleasant, such as meeting a new dog or smelling something foul.

These dogs use their voices to communi- cate with other dogs and to express frustration when left alone or feeling stressed.\n\n» Play growl: Puppies often growl during play, especially during confrontational games like tug-of-war, physical wrestling, or face-to-face sparring. It can and should be easily calmed or diffused by redirecting the play to an object or chewing type of toy.\n\n» Pleasure seeking: Many dogs growl or moan when enjoying a rub or scratch.

And you know what they say about habits: They’re hard to break.\n\n» Belly growl: A more serious growl emanates from the belly. This growl means the dog is about to bite.

A puppy barks at seeing the neighbors walking their dog. If you yell, your puppy will interpret your raised and frustrated tones as barking.

Babies cry when a need over- whelms them; puppies, though they may occasionally whimper, get nippy and restless.\n\nAs kids mature, they learn to communicate their needs with words; your puppy can’t talk, but they’ll mature, too. In place of spoken language, they will gesture their needs if you’ve laid the groundwork by pairing each need with a routine.

Though this makes them ideal companions, they can grow frustratingly fussy when overtired: Think of a toddler having a meltdown. Now imagine that toddler with teeth. If your puppy is mouthy to the point of snapping, it may have little to do with their personality and more to do with needing a routine rest. Turn to Chapter 7 for a proper sleep schedule.

Like kids, some puppies have a hard time putting themselves to sleep, espe- cially when excitement levels are high. Designate a quiet room for napping (using a crate, pen or gate to contain your puppy), and place them down for scheduled naps during the day. In my house, having 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. naps helped me sched- ule my day, too. Each time you lead your puppy to their resting area, say a cue word or phrase, like “In you go.” Eventually, your puppy will go to this area on their own when they’re tired.\n\nPuppies enjoy predictable routines. A hungry puppy is understandably upset and may show you by eating anything — even difficult-to-digest items such as tis- sues or walls. Schedule feeding times and stick to them, whether you feed all or a portion of your puppy meal by hand or from a bowl. If you notice your puppy get- ting nippy or difficult, check your watch. The behavior may be a result of hunger tension.\n\nIn Chapter 5, I argued for hand feeding your puppy their meals when possible. If you’re out of the house around normal feeding times, however, you can now buy timed feeders that you can set or program with an app. If your schedule is less than predictable or you know you may be called away during mealtimes, consider this option.\n\nA young puppy has a high metabolism and should have more frequent meals. Schedule three to four meals throughout the day, slowly phasing out meals as your puppy matures. At some point after your puppy reaches 10 months to a year, they may naturally drop one meal. Most dogs, however, prefer two feedings a day.",

That said, try to monitor their drinking habits while house- training them. Establish a drinking station for your puppy and keep their dish there, whether it’s empty or full. Give water with meals, after playing, chewing, or napping, and as you’re on your way to the potty area.\n\nRestrict water after 7:30 p.m., unless you want to be up all night taking your puppy outside. If your puppy needs a drink, either give them a small amount or offer a couple of ice cubes.\n\nAlthough dogs have many fewer taste buds overall (humans have 9,000 to their 1,700), your puppy has a ring of taste buds on the tip of their tongue that make water taste sweet. Pretty cool.\n\nI don’t think house-training can be summed up any better than with the wonder- ful maxim “Whatever goes in must come out.” Your puppy’s biological clock will have them eliminating on demand.

Your puppy needs a schedule, a routine, and a consistent pattern — all of which are within your grasp.\n\nIf you’re having house-training difficulties, refer to Chapter 14.\n\nThe urge to play and express themselves energetically is one of the most natural responses in your puppy’s repertoire. As with children, play and lighthearted interactions can be fabulous instructional tools and can be used exclusively during your first few months together.\n\nHow you play with your young puppy determines your long-term relationship. Rough games, such as wrestling or chase communicate confrontation, which can be scary and may lead to aggression or mischief. Great games such as the 2-ball toss or soccer and name games (which I describe in Chapter 20) instill cooperation and a fun-loving attitude — this puppy won’t ever want to leave your side.\n\nThe answer to the age-old question “When should I start training my puppy?”",

Hint: If your puppy wants your attention, wait until they have all four paws on the floor before you address them.\n\nPreparing for your puppy-baby’s homecoming is a lot like getting ready for a baby.

A carpet- free space is ideal; rolling up area rugs at the corners may tempt a pup to chew, and the absorbent texture may prompt elimination. Tape wires down, remove all low-sitting temptations, and place your shoes elsewhere. Place the puppy’s com- fort station at the corner of this room as well. (See the next section.)\n\nThe free-play zone should be free of items that the puppy shouldn’t play with (such as the hanging towels and doll shown in Figure 7-1). A little puppy-proofing can prevent a lot of problems.\n\nIf your puppy’s free-play zone blocks another pet’s domain, reorganize your resi- dent pet’s area well in advance of the puppy’s arrival. For example, if your cat’s bowls and litter box are within the puppy’s area, relocate them before you bring your puppy home so that your cat won’t feel displaced by the new arrival. For more tips on introducing your pup to the resident pets, flip to the section “ Introducing other pets,” later in this chapter.\n\nFIGURE 7-2: Give your puppy an area in all the rooms you share.\n\nFeed your puppy by their comfort station in their free-play zone or, if they’re distractible, in a gate or crate within the free-play zone.

Put your puppy’s toys and bones on the mat, and if possible, arrange the water dish nearby. Sit by your puppy’s calming station with them and treat them so that they think the area is special. If you make this area the focal point of your interactions, your puppy will bond to it quickly.

Designate a gated area as their sleep space, or put their crate in an area free from a lot of foot traffic and incoming light so that they can sleep undisturbed. (It wouldn’t hurt to pull the blinds or drape a towel over your puppy’s crate to create a den-like feeling.) Because puppies are attuned to all sounds, block distant noises by leaving on soft rock or lullaby music so that your puppy doesn’t feel left out. Whether you choose a crate or a gated room, make it cozy by laying down a mat and an article of your clothing, as well as a puppy pacifier (see Chapter 5) or bone to self-soothe your puppy if they should grow restless. Avoid fluffy beds or cushions because either can encourage chewing or accidents.\n\nSleeping is one of your puppy’s basic needs — just as important to their develop- ment as eating and drinking. When puppies don’t get enough sleep, they act fran- tic to the point of distraction, often becoming incessantly mouthy. Many show aggressive tendencies when continuously overtired, much like a colicky infant.\n\nUnlike people, who as adults are diurnal — resting 8 hours or one-third of a 24-hour cycle — dogs are crepuscular, most awake at dawn and dusk and resting for the remainder of the day. This factor makes them ideal pets because your day can be organized to play 20 minutes an hour with them before 9 a.m. and after 4 p.m.\n\nAs far as creating a habitual daytime sleep schedule goes, organize their nap times during the day for those times when you’re busy or working anyway. Until they reach 8 months of age, your puppy should have a noontime visit to feed, take comfort, and relieve themselves.",

Initially have the crate in the open area, using it as toy central.\n\nPlace toys, treats, and bones just inside the crate, and then let your puppy’s curiosity take over. From the start, place their food near the opening, gradually moving each meal closer to the door.\n\n2. After a couple of days, play the “in-we-go, out-we-go” game.\n\nTake high-value treats and sit by the opening of the crate. This is a hands-off exercise — no touching or forcing your puppy into the crate. Shake the cup or hold a treat to your puppy’s nose, and then toss in the treat. Say “in-you-go” as your puppy goes into the crate to find it, and “out-you-go” as they leave the crate. Play this game three to five times and quit before your puppy loses interest.",

Puppies need two full nap periods and a good night’s sleep to mature into calm, sensible dogs.

Use your puppy’s natural sleep cycles and chew toys to teach them to self-soothe or rest when left alone.\n\nCrates aren’t ideal for older puppies who may be suffering from separation anxi- ety.

    "page_content": "Here are a few tricks I’ve found useful in dispelling early tension, frustrations, and fights:\n\n» Model, model, model. The saying “Monkey see, monkey do” applies to children, too. Because your children pick up on habits by watching you, show them how to act with actions instead of words. I can assure you that\n\nsomething is bound not to go as planned, but if you stay calm and ignore the impulse to badger or boss, you’ll have a more relaxed home on your hands. Kids react poorly to negative reprimands. Stay cheerful and model the right behavior while your children are watching. Like monkeys, they see — and then they do.\n\n» Assign tasks. Make a chart assigning everyone a job ahead of time. Make raising the puppy a fun family affair where everyone plays the role of the parent.\n\n» Talk to your kids ahead of time. Get them involved in your plans and warn them of all the possible situations that may arise. For instance, the puppy may be sad and withdrawn and may not want to interact with anyone — they’re missing their littermates. Though the kids may be let down, everyone must respect the puppy — they’ll snap out of it in a few days. On the other hand, the puppy may be nippy and want to play rough — again, a carryover from their first family. (See Chapter 15 for tips on handling a mouthy puppy.) Make sure the kids are aware of the possibility, and help them interact with the puppy when they’re calm.\n\nRemind the kids that puppies need a lot of sleep — especially during the first 6 months. Let them decide on the music choices and placement for the puppy’s nursery, and show them the sleep schedule so that they can take a role in putting the puppy down for naps and bedtime.",

Help create a plan if a situation with the puppy gets out of hand, referencing Chapter 8 for some creative ideas like Alligator Island (every kids favorite), Fishing for Fido and the Run Run Stop game.\n\nIf redirecting your puppy doesn’t work teach your kids to clear the area!\n\nEveryone gets excited when they hear the word puppy. Friends and neighbors crawl out of the woodwork and want to welcome you home. Don’t be persuaded! Limit early introductions to only the closest friends and family. Resist extracur- ricular visits and drive-by welcomes until the next week, when your puppy has fully transitioned and has bonded with the household.\n\nSometimes your friends can be the hardest to control. Many will, without provo- cation, share their views on everything from house-training to how to discipline your puppy when they misbehave. Listen respectfully, but stay the course. Even though your friend may speak the gospel about what worked for their puppy, you’re not raising their puppy — you’re raising your own. As children, what works\n\nfor one pup may not work for another. If you follow everyone’s advice, you risk confusing your puppy. If you need more help than this book offers, skip your friends’ advice and sign up for a class or call a respected professional.",

    "page_content": "When the time has finally come for you to introduce your new pup to your friends, gather some treats and offer them to your visitors as they come in. Offer them a chair or ask them to sit on the floor as your puppy approaches. Ask them to extend the treat but not release it until your puppy is calmly standing or sitting on all four paws. By ignoring them when they’re excited and petting them when they’re calm, you’re getting a head start on encouraging good manners.\n\nThough you and your family want all the pets to be friends, you have to realize that your resident pets will not be wearing party hats when you walk through the door with a new companion in your arms. Young puppies are especially annoying to other animals — and the oodles of attention they get will be off-putting to the resident pets. Some time must pass (up to 6 months, in some cases) for everyone to get used to each other.\n\nThe following sections highlight some species-specific tips to help ease the tension.\n\nTry to organize the introductions at a time when your resident dog is the calmest and, preferably, after play, meals, and exercise. If your dog doesn’t know the Find It game, teach it to them by casting treats or parts of their meal on the floor while instructing “Find it.” (See Chapter 20 for a more detailed explanation.)",

Place the puppy in a crate or playpen either in someone else’s house or apartment or outside in a clean and safe environment as you approach with your dog on a loose leash. Each time your dog sniffs or looks at the puppy, mark the moment with a word like “puppy- good” or use a clicker as described in Chapter 5, and then toss a treat to the floor: Find it! If you’re unconcerned about your dog’s reaction, let the two sniff each other while your friend either holds the puppy in their lap or sits with the puppy on the floor.\n\nNext, proceed into the house. Use a pen off to one side of the house or gate the puppy away from the main living area until your first dog is familiar and more at ease with the presence of the puppy. From the outset, give your resident dog the\n\nroyal treatment, feeding and greeting them first (dividing their meals into as many meals as you’re feeding the puppy). If your resident pet approaches you while you are, or anyone is, interacting with the puppy, turn away from the puppy and address them immediately. Don’t allow the puppy to push the other pets aside for your attention; just ignore them or gently block their inclusion by turning away.\n\nWhen allowing your puppy to mingle in your home, affix a light indoor freedom line (see Chapter 5) or leash onto your puppy’s collar to allow for quick redirection if the puppy is too playful or is annoying your resident dog.",

If you’re able, praise your resident, reminding them that they are still the queen and lead them away from the puppy with a promise of a treat. Your puppy must learn that your older dog is not its mother or another puppy. Reassured and given more treats for tolerating the pup’s presence, they will slowly grow on each other.\n\nGrowling, teeth snarling, and pinning are not unusual dog behaviors when two dogs first meet. Dogs organize their relationship based on seemingly odd interac- tions. Almost immediately, one dog appears to yield while the other controls the interaction. However, if one dog appears vicious or the discourse continues for more than 30 seconds or escalates to where both dogs are fighting each other, separate the dogs immediately and call a professional to help smooth the intro- ductions. I’m often called to introduce a new puppy into a household to ensure everyone starts on the right paw.\n\nSome older dogs, when faced with a new puppy in their home, completely with- draw, going so far as to act as though they’ve never met you. Don’t be put off. Instead, just shower them with love and attention. If your youngster badgers or bullies your resident dog for sport, discourage it immediately by using a drag lead or a quick spritz of water from a spray bottle",

    "page_content": "If you bring a new older puppy into the group — one who is old enough to be walked on a leash — it’s best to have a friend help you and let the dogs meet on a walk at a location unfamiliar to both dogs. Manage the two dogs so that when walking side-by-side, you can guide them to sniff bottoms instead of being forced at one another face-to-face. Let your resident sniff first, and then guide the puppy back so that when walking slightly behind, you can gradually walk the puppy to greet your dog, rump facing.\n\nIf you’re earnestly concerned that your resident dog may harm the puppy, muzzle them or keep hold of their leash to enable easy interference. You can also call in a professional to walk you through it.\n\nAdding two puppies to your house is more like having twins than adopting two ham- sters, two fish, or two cats. The first year is quite the balancing act. House-training, fran- tic chewing escapades, and nipping and jumping habits are often more than twice the effort because one puppy influences the other and, in the end, may tune you out. You need the 3 Ps — patience, persistence, and positive attitude — to keep the training ball moving forward at a steady pace. That said, raising two puppies can give you hours of entertainment watching them play and experience life together; just keep this image in mind while you’re devoting hours to raising your twins.\n\nWhen left together 24 hours a day, your puppies will form a strong bond to each other, which is good. However, that means they’ll also be less attached to you, which makes influencing their behavior difficult. To prevent that level of bonding, separate them at least twice a day and, if possible, let them sleep in separate bedrooms. Have two crates so that each pup gets used to having their own space.",

    "page_content": "Here are additional hints for making life a little easier for everyone in the 2-puppy house:\n\nRemember that each puppy is different. Sure, certain similarities string all pup- pies together. However, like humans, each one has their unique personality and temperament that affect the way they relate to their world. In a multidog house- hold, everyone must be sensitive to the needs of each puppy.\n\nLet your puppies establish their hierarchy. Personality affects the way puppies relate to one another. Groups of two or more puppies form a hierarchy, with the most outgoing, assertive one assuming the bossier position and often the more protective, demanding role. You may have trouble figuring out which puppy is the leader of your group because it’s not often a straightforward delineation. Puppies don’t base hierar- chy on who’s the biggest or who came first. Nor do they base it wholly on who’s the toughest. Hierarchy is most often based on who’s the most responsible or level- headed in a given situation. The puppy with both the brains and the brawn wins out. Regardless of your feelings, you must support their arrangement.\n\nRemember the discipline rules. The best advice I can give you here is don’t get hot-headed with your puppies. Your puppy won’t understand things that happened moments ago, and together, both pups will view you as a buzzkill. Sure, you’ll get frustrated when you find a mess of any kind — I get that! My family rescues prob- lem dogs, and sometimes I think it’s just to test my resolve.",

    "page_content": "Directing your frustration at either puppy only weakens your connection to them and strengthens their bond. For suggestions on specific problems, see Chapters 15-17.\n\nAllow wrestling, to a degree. Teach your puppies to go outside or to certain areas of your home to play. If they tend to get out of hand, make treat cups (see Chapter 5) and teach them a universal name like “Pups!” Clap your hands when the play esca- lates, say “Pups,” and then direct them with the treat cup to their play area or redi- rect them to a bone.\n\nPlay the name game. Teach your puppies two names: their names and a universal one that you can use when they’re together, such as “dogs,” “girls,” “boys,” or “babies” — whatever works for you. Using a single name makes calling them easier; “Girls, come!” rolls off the tongue easier than “Buddy, Fifi, Daisy, Marlo, come!” Play the name game with the treat cup, shaking it as you run from them, and then turn- ing and saying “Wait!” Reward them by tossing the treats down (see the Find It game described in Chapter 20) so that you don’t mistakenly encourage jumping.\n\nFeed your pups separately. If you’re having difficulty keeping the puppies sepa- rate, create two separate feeding stations. (See Chapter 5.)\n\nAvoid starting a toy war. I know you want them both to have a toy. But one puppy keeps insisting on having both. You give it back to the other puppy, and they take it away. The giving and taking can go on all day. Remember your leadership rule: If the more assertive puppy wants both, the more assertive puppy gets both. Period.",

Overreacting can put all species on edge.\n\nFollowing are some suggestions to help the introductions go smoothly:\n\n» Place the puppy in a gated room or open playpen (with a special chewy for diversion) and let your cat wander around the room at their own pace. Don’t try to influence or interfere in your cat’s reaction. Reward any interest your cat takes in the new addition with a favorite treat or toy.

Directing your frustration at the cat will only make matters more stressful. Your cat is defining their space, which is a necessary boundary for coexistence. Reward any initiative your cat takes to stay in the room with the puppy, erecting shelves or cat trees to satisfy your cat’s instincts to mark (they will scratch an upright post) and climb safely out of reach.\n\nIf you have farm animals or other pets in the house — such as ferrets, birds, or rodents — give the puppy a few days to acclimate to your home before introducing the rest of the menagerie. If your pup’s reaction concerns you, attach a leash to curb their enthusiasm and redirect them to a toy or bone. If your puppy seems too assertive (generally experienced with older puppy rescues), they may not have had the proper conditioning for living harmoniously with other animals during their socialization period.

Because your puppy won’t be used to sleeping alone, they’ll often be distressed and up all night calling for their littermates. Keep your newbie close to you for the first few nights at least. If you must leave them alone, play soothing music to ease the fear of unfamiliar noises.\n\nThe first week is quite progressive. By day two or three, you’ll notice your puppy watching you and getting excited when you walk through the door. You may be surprised to note the different reactions, but their emerging reactivity is a sure sign that they feel safe and welcomed. Try to keep yourself calm, especially when your puppy gets excited, because you don’t want to encourage hyper greeting manners before your puppy has cut their baby teeth.\n\nOrganize the day, using the sleep and house-training schedule shown in Table 7-1, and remain patient with accidents or exploratory chewing, especially if your puppy is in the infant stage (younger than 16 weeks of age). If you notice your puppy chewing furniture or wires, use a distasteful bitter-apple spray to discour- age their curiosity, or tape the wires out of reach. Puppy-proof each area you share by placing objects such as dish towels and shoes out of reach. Prevention is worth pounds of cure.\n\nAvoid loud or physical interference, because it only overwhelms your puppy and discourages bonding.

Voilà — you now have a treat cup. Shake it and reward your puppy until they make the association between the sound and getting a treat. Next, call their name when they’re unsuspecting as you shake the cup and reward their attention. Within a day or two, phase off the cup and watch as your puppy alerts happily to their name.\n\n» Teaching your puppy where to go to get each of their needs met: Your puppy will be most focused on where to go for food, water, sleep, and potty. Assign words to each routine, as detailed in the Needs chart (Table 6-2) at the end of Chapter 6, to help your puppy associate words with actions.\n\nThe first month with any puppy is a critical bonding time. As the days and weeks pass, you’ll notice your puppy’s confidence and awareness of you growing. They’ll initiate routines by going to the door when they have to go out or standing by their bowl at mealtime. Your puppy is communicating with you! Now you can continue the magic by thinking of early efforts as though you were teaching a newly adopted baby English as a second language. Your puppy’s first language is posturing and body cues; though they can learn words, you’ll need to pair them with gestures and routines. By paying attention and interpreting the meaning behind their actions, you’ll forge a bond that will last a lifetime.\n\nWhen puppies are very young, their whole bodies and brains are absorbed in encoding new experiences, from the smells in your kitchen to the sound of the dishwasher. How puppies react to these sensations depends on their temperament and how you engage and interact with them.",

    "page_content": "Here is a quick list of habits and words to get started on during the first month you’re together:\n\n» “Get your ball or toy.” When playing with your puppy, say “Go get your toy” as you toss a toy and let them chase it. I love the toys that are attached to a pole — they’re perfect for exhausting and diverting your puppy’s hunting and grabbing energy. Use the phrase to play and redirect your puppy whenever they’re excited; when greeting people, for example.\n\nDon’t worry about retrieving games at this stage: Most puppies are too young to share. The goal of this game is to teach your puppy what they can grab, have, and hold (“Go get your ball or toy!”) and what they can’t — namely, you. » Play treat cup games. Make a treat cup as described in Chapter 5. After your puppy makes the sound-treat connection, teach them the 4-paw rule. Shake the cup and reward your puppy if they hold still; if they jump, lift the cup above your head and look up. Flip to Chapter 8 to learn how to condition an automatic Sit, and then incorporate Sit into this routine. You can use the treat cup to teach your puppy to come to their name — shake the cup and run 5 to 10 feet away from your puppy as you call their name; say “Come” as you release the treat.\n\n» “Say hello.” To encourage proper greeting manners, wait to greet your puppy until they’re calm enough to sit for a treat. As you reach out to pet them, say the words “Say hello.” Eventually, they will learn that this phrase means to greet people on all four paws. Remember that good manners start at home.",

When your puppy nips your hand, let your hand go limp until they stop, or remove their mouth gently as you remind them to give “kisses” instead. More tips in Chapter 15.\n\nPuppies aren’t perfect: Not all their messages are heartwarming. Sometimes your puppy will be bored and demand your attention by jumping up, barking, or grab- bing a shoe or paper towel. As you work through the many joys and frustrations of puppyhood, remember that even bad behavior is a sign of healthy development — it signals that your puppy is engaged, focused, and dependent on you. This is the time to start communicating your routines and rules to your puppy in a calm, consistent manner.\n\nA lot of what they learn happens when you don’t even know it, like when you approach their gate or crate. Wait until your puppy is relaxed and standing on all four paws in their enclosure before you open or step over a gate or lift them out; otherwise, you’ll teach the opposite. It’s the same with food or water: Wait to lower the dish until your puppy can sit still. Whining and barking are other habits that start early. Ignore your puppy’s vocal demands unless you’re certain that they need to go out. More tips on dealing with all sorts of frustrating behavior are in Chapter 15; skip ahead, if you need to.\n\nPuppies, like kids, love attention. And, like kids, they don’t care if the attention is negative or positive. Shouting, pushing, and grabbing wont’ discourage a puppy — they’re interpreted as confrontational play and make a puppy more reactive, not less.",

    "page_content": "During the first month, your puppy will experience everything for the first time. Given all the sounds and stimulations they face, there is sure to be something that will likely startle your puppy: Fear of the unknown is completely natural and your puppy’s startle reflex, a powerful force. Stay calm. Though you’ll be tempted to soothe your puppy when they’re fearful of an object or sound, the best approach is to stay calm and act like it’s nothing. The been-there-seen-that attitude gives your puppy far more reassurance than bending over and soothing them, and it encourages them to look and bond to you as their authority on everything life-related.\n\nSome puppies relish the comfort of being held in someone’s arms. Many small breeds love the reassurance of being held tightly by someone larger whom they trust. But, like kids, no puppy wants to be held all the time. Pick up your puppy only when they’re calm and restful. If your puppy squirms to be let down, don’t take it personally. There’s a time to hold and a time to let go.\n\nWhen holding a puppy, keep their spine to the ceiling and belly to the floor: This is a great mantra for kids and grown-ups alike. I refer to the proper way to hold a puppy as the heart hold, where you embrace the puppy sideways so that your hearts are pressed together, holding their hips and shoulder joints snug to your body.\n\nPuppies don’t like to have their legs dangling, and many puppies feel scared when flipped on their back. If your puppy appears to be uncomfortable in your arms, they are. Ask your veterinarian or another professional how to best lift, carry, and hold your puppy if you need guidance. By holding your puppy securely, they’ll sense your loving power, which helps them bond to you.",

If you’re certain that the dog or other puppy is safe and can be trusted not to attack your puppy, kneel down and let the bigger dog smell your puppy thoroughly. If a helper is present, ask them to hold your puppy while you pet and playfully engage the other dog. You’re letting your puppy witness your courage firsthand. In the moment, or over time, your puppy will grow more confident greeting other dogs and learn that sniffing is the proper way to say hello — at least if you’re a dog.\n\n» Learning the laws and unwritten doggie etiquette codes in your community\n\nBringing up a well-rounded puppy isn’t a 1-person job, even if you live alone.\n\nHowever, if you’re surrounded by family members or friends, striking a balance between consistency and cooperation takes some effort. You soon find out that sometimes your puppy is easier to train than your partner, kids, or roommate. If you’re living near other people — whether in a subdivision, an apartment complex, or a busy urban neighborhood — incorporating your newbie may be tricky too. You’ll quickly discover just who is a puppy lover and who isn’t. Another paramount goal is finding the right outside help — from a veterinarian and dog walker to a fun, informative puppy teacher. In this chapter, you discover how to pull together Team Puppy to help raise a happy, well-behaved dog.\n\nIf I were asked to boil down family life with a new puppy to a single all-important concept, it would be this: Be consistent.

If one person welcomes the rowdy puppy, while another gets mad, and still another tries to redirect their attention to a toy, the puppy will not have a clear vision on the proper greeting etiquette in your home.\n\nIf you can give your puppy one gift, let it be this: Gather your family around and decide on a few ground rules, such as whether you’ll let your puppy do any of the activities in this list:\n\nThough the answers to some of these questions might seem obvious to you, every- one is different and may not see it your way. Have the discussions up front and away from the puppy to avoid in-the-moment aggravations.\n\nEncouraging Positive Interactions between Kids and Pups\n\nOne hallmark of my childhood was my dog, Shawbee, who was a husky-shepherd mix. She was my constant companion, waiting for me at the bus stop, hanging outside the church while I took ballet lessons, and sharing my ice cream cone on a hot summer day.\n\nToday, kids are often overstimulated at a young age, and they have less time to hang out with dogs. Riding bikes and running around are often limited to parks where dogs aren’t allowed. To boot, young puppies and young kids don’t always hit it off. In some circumstances, the puppy views the child as another puppy to bite and bully. At other times, a child becomes jealous of the attention the new addition is getting, which leads to sibling rivalry between the child and the puppy. But as the ringleader in your household, you can help your kids and puppy hit it off and have a rewarding relationship.",

Face it: To a 5-year-old, mud wrestling for two hours is more exciting than a 2-minute “Follow” lesson. Training exercises are just no fun, and the phrase “It’s your responsibility to feed Roxy” has a negative spin. The good news is that your kids get involved when the routines are upbeat and creative.\n\nBefore you teach the kids how best to play and teach the puppy, buy or make treat cups (see Chapter 5) and fill them with a trail mix of some tasty treats or mealtime kibbles. If your kids are crafty, have them decorate the cups with markers or stick- ers. When that’s taken care of, have them try out three quick kid-safe games they can play with the puppy:\n\n» Multi-toy toss. Perch a child (or two) on a kitchen counter or have the kids stand on the opposite side of the gate, with five or more of the puppy’s favorite toys. Have the kids say “Wait” as they hold the toy in front of the puppy, but have them hold off tossing until the puppy is still. Urge a tossing phrase like “Go get your toy!” Don’t worry about fetching at this point. When your puppy grabs the toy, have the kids pull out another and call the puppy over to start the process all over again.",

    "page_content": "» Run-run-stop. Play this game with your kid or kids until your puppy shows good impulse control — not jumping or nipping, in other words. Begin by standing with your puppy and child in the free-play area or outdoors. Give your child the treat cup, have them shake it as they call the pup’s name, and then have them run just five steps away from the puppy. After a short run the child turns and holds out their arm like a traffic cop, saying “Stop” in a strong voice. The moment your puppy stops and holds still they should drop a treat at their feet, saying “Find it!”\n\nIf the puppy jumps or nips, either place a freedom line on your puppy so that you can interfere by stepping on it or have the child cover their eyes with their hands (the peek-a-boo solution described in Chapter 15), or, if the puppy scares them, lift or place the child out of reach. (If your child is too young to manage this game on their own, recruit them as your special helper as you play it for them.)\n\n» Hide-n-seek. Give your kid (or kids) a treat cup and ask them to hide around the corner or a piece of furniture. Have them wait to shake the cup and then have them call their puppy the moment you say the child’s name. When your child is out of sight, ask your puppy “Where’s Sophie?”— at which point Sophie should call your puppy as she shakes the treat cup. If your puppy is confused, go with them to find the child. Start with easy finds before moving outside or attempting more challenging hides.\n\nDon’t leave young children alone with a puppy: Both species are mastering impulse control and can hurt each other unintentionally.",

Kids can run hot and cold: One minute they encourage play with their puppy, and the next they’re shouting that the puppy is hurting them. Neither species is all that sensible, and you’ll have to step in more often than not.\n\nMy favorite phrase, whether you’re raising kids or puppies, is this: You’re the one on the park bench; they’re the ones on the rollercoaster. In other words, when either the kid or the puppy is getting wild, you need to remain calm. Yelling at either puppy or child will upset the balancing act between them even more.\n\nHere are some quick phrases and kid-safe moves I use with families in my private practice. They get life back on course as quickly as their wacky energy spirals out of control. Bottom line? Though kids and puppies love to play, their interactions can become scary to kids when the puppy starts nipping in fun.\n\n» Alligator Island: Designate a countertop in your free-play zone as Alligator Island. Lift the kids onto the counter or tell them to hop up there for safety. After they’re safe on the island, they should ignore the pup until they’re calm or, if they want to continue playing, toss toys once the puppy stands or sits calmly on all four paws.\n\n» See you later: As long as your kid and puppy are still working out the rules of play, make sure there’s an easy exit over the gate or out the door. Use a phrase like “Bye-bye” or “See you later” as you leave quickly anytime your puppy is jumping or nipping.",

Teach the kids to toss treats on the floor and say “Find it” instead of directly handing the puppy the treat. Place treat cups in strategic locations and teach kids to use them to redirect the puppy when they become rowdy.\n\nTreats tossed on the floor teach puppies to look down when they’re anticipating a reward.\n\nSet up situations that your pup can expect to encounter to teach them how to han- dle themselves — such as the kids’ running frenzies, snack time, or floor-level gaming. Redirect your puppy’s focus away from the kids, using techniques like the counter condition skills and desensitization techniques detailed in Chapter 15. If your puppy can’t detach from the kids’ fun, use a freedom line and a choice of compassion wear (see Chapter 5) so that choking their neck doesn’t intensify their frenzy. With a leash and the right training techniques, you can remedy many everyday occurrences between kids and puppies — behavior like mouthing and nipping, food grabbing, and chasing.

Take the puppy from the crate to the designated bathroom spot, saying “Go to the papers,” or “Outside.”\n\n2. Wait to give the pup attention until they’re pottying in the right place. 3. Say “Get busy” as they potty, either poop or pee. 4. Greet, play with, or walk the puppy after they’re done. In preparation for the inevitable “accidents,” set up cleaning stations in strategic places, equipped with paper towels and house-soiling spray.\n\nAll puppies are enthusiastic about their relationships and naturally try to get “up close and personal” whenever it’s time for a proper greeting. That means they instinctively want to jump up and engage in some face-to-face contact, just like Great-Aunt Ernestine used to do.

You can narrow your search by asking your friends and family whom they use and why.\n\nPuppies can be quite impulsive — they often swallow things that look edible before even considering whether they are. So, at your puppy’s first veterinary visit, ask the doctor for a recommended method for inducing vomiting. You should also find out the poison-control hotline number and always keep it on your phone in case of an emergency. Seek out a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital in your area as well. Keep the hospital’s number by or on your phone. Accidents can happen during off hours, so have a plan.\n\nWhether your life demands consistent hours away from home or circumstance steps in to temporarily rearrange your schedule, knowing a dog walker can make the difference between a happy puppy and a stressed-out one. Puppies are like human babies in that they have a strong need dependency. Even though an adult dog can hold their bladder until you get home or can survive until a late meal, your puppy may well eat the walls of your house if you get stuck in traffic. A reliable dog walker can be a godsend in times like these.",

People training is a big part of my program too: I teach my human clients the importance of sitting or kneeling to pet or handle their puppy instead of bending over them, creating calming station for their puppy in the rooms they share, and playing with their puppy to strengthen their bond. Consistent rituals, like food sleep and potty rituals, can make all the difference in having a puppy who feels calm and one that is anxious and out of sorts. In my world, training is as much for the people as the puppy. At the end of the day, puppies need to learn where to go and what to do in a range of situations: “Sit” as a matter of saying please, “Come” to mean that you’re standing together, and “Get your bone” and “Go to your place” as a way to offer comfort when your puppy is fretting or alone.",

They use physical discipline and often bully their clients’ puppies with threatening mannerisms and battery-operated shock or vibrating collars. I never encourage these methods. Although a puppy may stop a behavior—who wouldn’t freeze if shocked or threatened by a virtual stranger? — their cooperation comes at too high a cost to their joy and well-being. Fearful puppies may behave because puppies, like kids, are easily intimidated, but the majority mature to become manic or defensive dogs. Please avoid trainers suggesting any of these techniques.\n\nSometimes you just need a kind professional to sort out just how best to raise your puppy to be the dog you want them to be. Puppies are frustrating — I get that. They’re like children in their curiosity, energy, and desire for adventure. Raising a puppy is hard work, but your efforts will be rewarded!

What do these people want me to do?\n\nThat’s how your dog feels — like a fur-clad 2-year-old in a foreign land. A good dog trainer is like a nursery school teacher and a sympathetic translator rolled into one. Keep looking — you’re sure to find someone who has devoted their life to helping other people learn how to communicate and teach their puppies effectively.\n\nDog training even has franchises — just like a McDonald’s restaurant. Anyone with capital can invest and call themselves a dog trainer. Sure, most people get into dog training because they love dogs, but it takes more than just a savvy mar- keting plan to help people and dogs communicate effectively.\n\nA great option for busy families and professionals is digital dog training. With the advent of real-time nanny cams, your puppy’s behavior can be recorded, shared, and discussed without the trainer having to experience it firsthand. Generally, more cost-effective sessions can be organized online or over the phone that cover topics from how to choose the right dog or puppy to problem-solving and training issues.\n\nThe benefits are tremendous: I’ve been doing digital sessions globally with great success for years, offering fresh insight on a whole range of questions and frus- trations. It’s also a cost-effective and quick way for someone considering private help to test the waters. Before choosing a digital dog trainer, consider their repu- tation and certifications.",

Grooming is often a thankless job. You can greatly shape your puppy’s opinion of the groomer by exercising your puppy before bringing them in, keeping them combed between visits (to keep painful knots at bay), and introducing them to the groomer’s handling techniques from early puppyhood.\n\nWhen deciding on a groomer, review their qualifications and certifications. Visit each facility ahead of time and ask to see where the dogs are stationed while they’re waiting their turn or drying. What vibes do you get from each place? Do the dogs who are already there seem happy or stressed? Is it clean and almost odor free? Would you want to get a haircut there if you were a dog?\n\nWatch the groomer’s handling techniques. Is the person empathetic — do they speak gently or harshly to your dog? Though a groomer may need to be firm with your dog to keep them still during the process, they shouldn’t be cruel or abusive.\n\nIf the idea of wrangling your puppy into a groomer doesn’t get your tail wagging, you should realize that some groomers will come to your home, either using your bathing facilities or arriving in a full-service grooming van. Some of my clients use this service and are happy with it. Consider what you and your dog would prefer.\n\nI love the concept of daycare for your dog, especially if you work all day, but there are good daycare centers and poorly managed daycare centers.

That day, I swore I’d move to Barbados. However, the annoying barking was pitiful — poor Betsy the beagle was lonely, frantic for her family’s return.

If you’re new to puppyhood, it helps to know the basics: Fortunately, it isn’t too tricky. Here are the top five rules to being a good puppy neighbor:\n\n» Scoop the poop. Make a habit of cleaning up your puppy’s elimination the\n\nmoment they go to the bathroom. Aside from the obvious sanitation element, when your puppy is praised and sees you picking up their mess in the right location, they’re more likely to go there again.\n\n» Select the pooping place.

Though it’s tempting to want to walk your puppy as far from your home as possible, you wouldn’t potty- train a kid by sending them to the neighbors’ bathroom, right? Because dogs mark their boundaries (also known as their territory), make sure your puppy learns where their property begins and ends. If you let them potty around the ’hood, as they mature they may become more reactive or excitable on leash as puppies identify their territory by scent marking. If your puppy is the reactive type, they’ll likely be more reactive in the house as well, alerting when others pass your window.\n\n» Be mindful of barking. Waking up to a barking dog or puppy is no fun. Avoid letting your puppy out before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m., or talk to your neighbor if you’re worried that the barking might be bothering their peace of mind.\n\nBarking puppies are not happy puppies. If yours is barking uncontrollably, consider their state: Could chewing a bone, engaging in some interactive play, or experiencing the pleasure of your company calm their worries?",

Barking can develop into a bothersome routine if you don’t get a quick, calm, and steady handle on it; see Chapter 15 for tips. Do your part in puppyhood to limit the startle reactions in your puppy by conditioning them to everyday noises — ranging from visits from delivery people to sounds just beyond the wall to neighbors passing by the front window. To do this, simply place treat cups in strategic locations so that when you hear a familiar noise or either you see or the puppy sees something beyond reach, you can quickly grasp the cup, shake it, and redirect your puppy to a chew toy or fun activity. Remember to move back and away from the center of the distraction. For more help on this issue, flip ahead to Chapter 15 and read up on curbing the barking habit.\n\nWhen leaving your puppy, put on some gentle music to drown out incoming sounds, dim the lights and close the blinds to block activity, and leave them with a satisfying chew toy.\n\nIf you leave your puppy outdoors, provide them with access to a shaded area and plenty of fresh water. If you’re expecting inclement weather, don’t leave your puppy alone outside. Go with them to their potty area and bring them directly back inside after they’re done.\n\nIf your puppy suffers from separation anxiety, they will suffer more if crated.

Though the puppy parent may insist that the dog is friendly, you just don’t know how the dog will react to a stranger. If you meet someone who is walking a friendly-looking puppy of a similar age, first ask whether you can approach to say hi. Respect the parent’s decision whatever it is and don’t take offense: The puppy may be sick or the person preoccupied or in a hurry.\n\nTeach walking skills on a 6-foot leash.

Never use retractable leashes near roadways or crowds — too dangerous.\n\n» Introducing your puppy to strangers, wild animals, noises, and interesting objects\n\nYour puppy is born to be social — that’s the good news.

Being a scaredy-cat is no life for a dog, so devote the time early on (or hire a professional to do it for you) to get your pup acclimated to everything they will encounter throughout their life, from objects and people to noises and other animals.\n\nAll puppies need someone to look up to: Like kids, they’re eaily intimidated when they’re little. Though they idolize their birth mama, that attachment will transfer to you, and just like that, your puppy will be watching your interpretation of new people and experiences for guidance on how to react. This is the ideal bonding experience if you cop a been-there-done-that attitude. Stay calm, be confident (even if you have to pretend), and use lots of rewards to help your puppy see that life is nothing to fret over.\n\nIf your puppy is older than 16 weeks, don’t despair. Even though they have passed their ideal impression window, they’re still open to your example when they get overwhelmed or excited. A noticeably defensive or wary reaction simply indicates that your puppy has no conscious memory of such an occurrence and isn’t sure how to act. In these circumstances, your reactions to both the situation and the puppy are important.",

This chapter is here to help.\n\nMy favorite puppy quote is, to paraphrase Frederick Douglas, “It’s easier to build strong puppies than to repair broken dogs.”\n\nRecognizing the Critical Stages of Your Puppy’s Social Calendar\n\nSocializing your puppy to all of life’s surprises is just as important as training them during the first year. Though they may behave perfectly in your living room, if they fall to pieces when you hit the road, you won’t be able to take them anywhere. And your puppy has so much more in store for them than the usual distractions and people in your backyard. Exposing your puppy to different animals, weather situations, objects, noises, and places will encourage them to accept anything new throughout their life.\n\nPuppies, like children, go through developmental stages, and each stage brings with it a new perspective. In the earliest stages, everything is new, and your pup- py’s trust in you is innocent and faithful. This is the ideal time to get started. As long as you don’t react to a new stimulation, your puppy won’t, either — they’ll get conditioned to new noises, sights, and people, often without pause or hesitation.\n\nAs your puppy grows up, they’ll become less inhibited about how to act and will need persuading to stay focused on you. (Think food and fun here.) Here’s a list of puppyhood developmental stages; socialization ideally starts in the first days and weeks they’re born.",

Sure, they’re born blind and deaf (puppies’ eyes and ears open within four weeks of age) and can’t even potty without their moth- er’s stimulation, but at least their body is aware of temperature and motion. Devoted breeders start stimulating their puppies with a gentle touch from day one to prepare their pups for their eventual lives with people.\n\nAfter five weeks of containment, puppies explode into their first socialization period and learn from their mother and littermates what most kids pick up in kindergarten: In doggie terms, they learn about biting gently (what the pros call bite inhibition), respecting authority, and playing with an object to self-soothe. Unless you love a challenge (and I do mean a challenge), only adopt a puppy who has spent seven to eight weeks with their mother and littermates.\n\nSeven to 16 weeks is the period when your puppy’s brain grows, also called the critical socialization period, and for a good reason: Your puppy is creating mental pathways, learning routines, and developing habits that can last a lifetime; this is also the stage when your puppy will encode all the sights and sounds they will experience in their lifetime. That’s good if you expose them to lots of stuff, but not so good if you’re busy or you lose track of these most important weeks for your puppy. I’ll go over just how to socialize your puppy and tweak your response for different reactions (hyper, fearful, or defensive) later in this chapter, but suffice it to say that if you have a puppy, the time to start exposing them to just about everything is now.",

Puppies older than 16 weeks become purposeful and confident and may look at times like they’ve never even heard a human speak, even if training was started early. Adolescents are never pretty, no matter the species. At this stage, they start losing their puppy teeth and begin expanding like they’re on growth hormones — hence the term “growing phase.”",

Avoid the temptation to bend and soothe your puppy, because they may consider your reaction as modeling their behavior. Instead, adopt a been-there-done-that attitude, acting courageous and calm. Approach whatever distraction has rattled your puppy and — when possible — pretend to sniff it curiously. As your puppy overcomes their initial reaction, use treats to reward their baby steps. Continue to expose them to whatever the new distraction is for three to five minutes each day until they absorb the distraction as blasé.\n\nCommit now to socializing the paws off a fearful-type puppy. However, remember that it may take many outings to mellow their caution to the point that they’ll become more pleasant to have around.\n\nDon’t lift your puppy or coddle them if they have a fearful reaction. Your lowered body posture and high-pitched tone convey the message that you’re afraid, too. Let your puppy move out of the situation that’s overwhelming them, and then kneel and pet them with full strokes. Breathe deeply and stay calm: Your compo- sure will be reassuring.",

    "page_content": "Your puppy’s first thunderstorm or fireworks celebration may be a memorable event. The best thing you can do is act like it’s nothing — petting or soothing when your puppy is in a state of panic may model their fear, creating a panic reaction instead of what may initially have been just a normal caution response. Rather than model fear by crouching low, talking in a voice that sounds more like whining than confident reassurance, and staring at them in intense concern (your puppy may startle to being stared at this time), stay calm, use familiar directions, and keep your puppy with you. Here’s a helpful list of things to do when your puppy is unsettled by life’s unavoidable events:\n\nUse a leash in tandem with compassion wear. If your puppy has already devel- oped a fearful reaction to storms, use a leash affixed to your choice of compassion wear (see Chapter 5) to guide them through each episode rather than let them hide or run about in a state of panic.\n\nSet a good example. Put on soothing music and stay calm as you read or relax as if nothing is happening. If your puppy will eat, chew, or play with you, that’s a good sign: Offer them the opportunity. By staying calm and just reading a book or doing another low-key activity, you’re setting an example of how to act in a storm.\n\nUse a sound recording. If a specific sound is unsettling to your puppy, record it or see whether you can find a sound machine that has the sound prerecorded. Play it at gradually increasing volumes while your puppy is playing or eating. If they are still startled by the noise, lower the volume and play it in a distant room. If your puppy’s reactions don’t improve, speak to your veterinarian about medication.",

The dif- ference between their tension and ours is how they display it. Sure, I may pack on some extra pounds when I’m feeling anxious, but I don’t destroy the couch; your puppy may, though. And if you discipline an anxious pup, they’ll become more stressed and destroy other items — perhaps your rug or the bed. Is this a sign of spite? No, never: puppies live in the moment and in moment’s like these your puppy is just confused and worried, and they need your help to adjust. Other signs of stress are aggression, barking, hyperactivity, and extreme withdrawal. In this section, I advise you on how to ease your puppy’s stress when facing a move, when your household is coping with a death, or when adding a new family mem- ber to the home.\n\nMoving is one of life’s most stressful changes. First, the financial decisions may bring about more theatrical conversations than you have on an average day. Then you have the packing, shipping, and traveling back and forth. When the big day finally arrives, you’ve reached a new peak of exhaustion. If you have to move, my heart aches for you, but it bleeds for your developing puppy. Chaos often sends their routine into a tailspin. During this change, you may notice your puppy resorting to early puppy behavior: They may become hyper, demand attention, nip, jump, or chew. Forgive them and vow to help them cope.",

Also, use familiar words, schedules, and routines from day one. If you keep your day-to-day habits the same, your puppy will adapt in no time.\n\nThe first time you leave your puppy in your new home, they may stress out, resulting in destructive chewing or excessive barking. Confine your puppy in a small room or familiar pen or crate with your old shirts and a favorite chew toy; dim the lights and leave on comforting, familiar music. Don’t discipline your puppy if they demolish something. Your corrections only increase anxiety. If you return home to scenes of destruction, ignore them and clean up the area later when your puppy is occupied.\n\nDon’t let your puppy off-leash in your new yard unless it’s fenced in; they’ll be disoriented for a few weeks and may get lost if they wander off. Instead, let them explore their new surroundings on a reactable leash or freedom line, provided you’re a safe distance from all roadways.

Fortunately, you can take a few steps ahead of time to ensure that nobody gets left in the doghouse:\n\n» As early as possible, socialize your puppy with small children. Use treat\n\ncups as described in Chapter 5 to help your puppy associate kids with fun and food. Toss treats down, saying “Find it” as you cast them to the floor; this helps to ensure that your puppy stays focused on your hands and looks down instead of up when kids are around.

When changing your baby (both the doll and the real thing), practice the directions Wait, Go to Your Place, and Stay. See Chapter 11 for more on teaching your puppy these words.\n\n» Set new-furniture rules. I think it best not to keep your puppy on the\n\nfurniture around a new baby, but if you wait to spring this rule on your pup after the baby’s home, the puppy may feel confused or anxious.

Keep the second set of keys with you so that you can get back into the car. » Think careful, not cool. While driving, keep windows cracked but not wide\n\nopen.

    "page_content": "Many people picture bringing a puppy home during the “adorable” stage,\n\nbetween 8 and 14 weeks, and professionals do claim that it’s the best age to bond with a puppy. Though I agree that it’s an impressionable time, the truth is that you can bond with a puppy (or a dog, for that matter) at any age. It’s fun to watch a puppy morph through each developmental stage, but puppies are a lot of work, too; this chapter helps you get a focus on just what’s in store.\n\nSome breeders offer their puppy buyers what’s known as imprinting foster care after a puppy separates from their litter at seven or eight weeks old. This service involves paying someone else to house-train, socialize, and teach your puppy for weeks to months, depending on the arrangement. I’ve seen this work well for some of my clients and not so well for others: Much depends on who’s doing the foster care. The choice is up to you.\n\nBefore giving birth to my first child, I anticipated snuggly cuddles and long, lin- gering morning gazes — the two of us blissfully smothered in mutual adoration. Little did I know. The first months were in fact a blur of late-night crying jags, poopy diapers, and wishing that someone had prepared me for the labor involved in parenting. If you’re a new puppy owner or you’re preparing to bring home a puppy, let me help you out: At the stage between 8 and 14 weeks, your puppy is all about getting familiar with their surroundings and routines. Don’t expect too much from them. Even though a puppy at this age is capable of learning, their brain won’t finish developing until they’re 14 weeks old.",

    "page_content": "So, what can you really expect? First and foremost, puppies at this stage need tons of sleep: between 16 and 18 hours of quiet time. If you’re tempted to overstimulate your young puppy, don’t do it. Your puppy will end up acting like a colicky baby who is chronically sleep deprived. How can you tell? Puppies who need sleep act fidgety, pushy, and mouthy. Unless they get the right kind of sleep, overtired pup- pies develop into restless dogs — and you don’t want that.\n\nNor do you want to start off on the wrong foot when it comes to socializing your puppy. The most important lessons at this stage involve associating words with specific routines. Luckily for you, these lessons aren’t hard to teach. If you stay consistent, the associations should develop naturally as you tend to your puppy’s everyday needs. I outline just how to tackle this task in the following sections, so put the high-intensity exercise and training lessons on the back burner for now. If you’re disappointed that your puppy won’t be running that fancy doggy parkour obstacle course just yet, try not to be — there’s still a lot of fun to be had at this stage.\n\nAll puppies are programmed to look to their family’s body language and postures for clues on how to act, as I discuss in Chapter 6. Your first goal is to teach your puppy to listen for direction by outlining lessons similar to teaching a foreigner a new language. Using a say-n-show format, you’ll say words that tie into where you’re going or what your puppy is doing. When you pair words with action, your puppy will learn to listen for direction in no time.",

    "page_content": "Like a human baby, your puppy is paying attention to you all the time, absorbing everything going on around them at a rate never to be equaled again in their life- time. Young and impressionable, they look to others to learn how to handle new\n\nsituations. But they can’t understand what you’re teaching them until they learn to identify the meaning of certain words. After all, training isn’t an exercise in domination or control; it’s teaching English to your puppy so that you share a common language.\n\nTaking care of your puppy at this stage can be a little repetitive: it’s a continuous string of sleep-potty-eat-drink-potty-play-potty-sleep-potty — and then rinse and repeat. Bonding during this stage occurs as you calmly and routinely take care of these basic needs: Yes, those needs in fact involve eating, drinking, pottying, sleeping, and playing. Help your puppy learn their first words by teaching them where to go and what to do when all their needs are pressing. Your puppy desper- ately wants to know, “Where do I go when I am thirsty, hungry, or tired or need to potty?”\n\nYour puppy at this stage needs lots of potty breaks because their bladder muscles don’t fully develop until four to five months of age. For more on house-training your puppy, flip to Chapter 14.\n\nWith consistent routines, schedules, and word cues, your puppy will start indicat- ing their needs by initiating the routines you’ve shown them! (For printable puppy schedules, visit my website at SarahSaysPets.com.\n\nIn Table 10-1, I list five important routines your puppy should know at this stage, pairing each one with a word cue to help them link each routine with a specific action.",

Settle them in with a busy toy or chew to help them self-soothe. Avoid dragging them, pleading, feeling guilty, or getting cross.\n\nEach time you feed your puppy — whether by hand, bowl, or feeding toy — identify the activity with a word and routinely go to the same area to get their food. If they jump or bark, stop and walk away. Only feed a calm puppy.\n\nKeep your puppy’s water dish in the same area. Have them hold still before lowering the bowl.\n\nHelp your puppy identify their belongings by keeping their toys and bones in one area. Identify each object as you play with it.\n\nYour puppy will learn more quickly if training is incorporated into everyday habits and playtime. Use their name and directions like Sit and Find it as you share treats and food and play with toys. Your number-one routine will be to teach them where to go to the bathroom, as I discuss in Chapter 14.\n\nForget discipline at this stage because your pup is just too young to understand it. You succeed only in frightening them and eroding your relationship — and that’s not good.\n\nThis game is easy and fun and you’ll use it forever. Take a few kibbles, as outlined in Chapter 20, and drop them at your feet (gently at first), saying Find it. It’s that simple. How many repetitions does it take to teach your puppy this cue?

You can also use Find It to keep greetings with strangers on an even keel and teach cooperative leash walking skills.\n\nUse Find It when feeding your puppy. Toss one kibble at a time (a great game for children) as you encourage the 4-paw rule as detailed later, in the section “Help- ing your puppy learn the 4-paw rule,” or toss a few handfuls down for meal- time fun.\n\nTreat cups (see Chapter 5) help your puppy learn their name quickly. If your puppy has yet to associate the sound of the cup shaking with receiving a food treat, prac- tice shaking and rewarding until they do. Now make multiple cups and spread them around for easy access. When you’re ready to have your puppy learn their name, follow this 3-step process:\n\n1. Shake the cup and say the puppy’s name simultaneously. 2. Repeat until you get a quick response each time you call.\n\nUse this trick everywhere you spend time so your puppy will alert each time you call out.\n\n3.

You can’t teach your puppy to literally say please, but you can get them to use a gesture to say that they want something. If you consistently direct your puppy to sit before offering them anything they perceive as positive, they’ll sit when they want something just as readily as most dogs jump. Here are some situations where you want your puppy to say please:\n\n» When receiving meals, treats, or water » Before a ball toss or toy offering » Before doors open to let them in or out » Whenever they want an item on the counter or tabletop » Before car entrances and exits » During all greetings » During introductions to children and older people\n\nMake sure your puppy doesn’t generalize a learned routine, like Sit, to one spot, such as their place or your kitchen. Practice new routines in a variety of different places and around various people and situations.\n\nTeach your puppy that the word Come means you’re together, not apart. Eventu- ally, it will bring your puppy running from afar, but initially Come should reflect\n\ntouch, reassurance, and rewards, not separation and frustration. Here’s how to do it:\n\n1. Hold a treat in one hand. Hold the other hand open, palm out, 2 to 3 inches from your puppy’s nose. The instant your puppy touches their nose to your palm, say Come and drop the reward from the other hand, saying Find it!

You will continue the lesson in the next few chapters, using a building block approach: Practice inside, outside, and when socializing your puppy away from home.\n\nMost puppies enjoy playing with toys, but they won’t understand the concept of sharing for a while. To help your puppy along, play the following game. Try it first with your puppy on a leash and with some treats or a clicker in your pocket.

The goal is to teach your puppy that “Give” means “spit it out.” This action highlights your good intentions to play and not steal.\n\nYou can use a treat cup to encourage sharing. When your puppy has an object or a toy, shake the cup enthusiastically and say Give when they do.\n\nPractice these directions in the confines of a small room for five days, and then bring the direction into normally populated areas. Phase out the treats gradually. If your intention is to toss the toy, take it after they spit it out and toss it imme- diately. Praise them with an exclamation like this: “Good boy — let’s play!”\n\nEarlier in this chapter, I tell you about the importance of associating words with everyday routines; Table 10-1 gives some examples of phrases to use. The list of words you can use to identify your routines is endless, however. For example, you can teach your puppy the names of each room in your house, if you want to, or the name of each and every toy.\n\nWhatever phrase you choose, teach your puppy using the say-n-show format: Say the word and do the action.

It’s especially important to impress on puppies at this stage the impor- tance of the rule. Your puppy’s first lessons simply must include not jumping for treats, toys, or attention. Using the 4-paw rule (no notice or greeting or reward unless all four paws are on the floor) is easy at this stage. Every time your puppy jumps up at the gate to get attention or jumps during greetings, stop dead in your tracks and cover your face with your hands — a technique I refer to as the peeka- boo solution. (The idea here is to ostentatiously deny them the attention they seek.) If they jump for treats or toys, lift them out of reach. In all these situations, wait until your puppy is on all four paws to give them what they want.",

(Don’t worry: In time, they’ll be scampering up and down like the big dogs do.) Some larger-breed puppies, although big enough to use stairs, are afraid because their depth perception is only begjinning to develop around eight weeks of age.\n\nIf you have a puppy with stair phobia, help them walk the stairs, by wrapping your hands around their ribs and guiding them down slowly. A helper can crouch down to their level and shake a treat cup to cheer them on.\n\nIn Chapter 7, I talk about how you should set up your puppy’s free-play area. Start teaching your puppy their “place” ASAP — by putting a washable mat in a corner and arranging their toys and bowls nearby it. Teach your puppy the word Place by waving a toy or shaking a treat cup as you guide them to their area. Reward them after they have all four paws on the mat — good puppy! Should your puppy go on their mat on their own, keep treats handy to reward them.\n\nIn Chapter 14, I talk about how you can teach your puppy to ring a bell when they need to go outside to potty. The fact is, though, that your puppy can learn to ring a bell to get whatever they want. Hang one by the water dish to ensure that they stay hydrated, and by the doors so that they can alert you whenever they need to potty or want to come back inside. Tap the bell gently with your fingers just before you fill the water bowl or open the door — soon, your puppy will catch on and ring it, too.",

Walk your puppy to the door as normal, but just before opening the door, offer the bell to investigate. Once your puppy touches it, praise them and proceed with the routine.\n\nYoung puppies have strong oppositional reflexes (something I call entrapment panic) if they feel caught against their will in any way. It’s a survival instinct that may play out if you insist on forcibly walking your young puppy on a tight leash. If you do, they may buck, freeze up, bite through the leash, or yelp as though they were caught in a bear trap. Worst of all, when forced to yield to a leash, a puppy grows up instinctively pulling in an attempt to break free, and will bolt given the opportunity.\n\nIt’s okay to place a lightweight collar or harness on your puppy soon after you get them home. If they’re like most puppies, they’ll fuss at first by scratching at their neck or rolling on the floor. If they do, condition their cooperation by placing it on before meals or for 20-minute intervals while you play Find It or toss favorite toys. Does your puppy run from you or back up when you approach to place their collar/harness on them? If so, kneel or pick them up first, use a spreadable treat or crumbly treat that you can place on the ground, and then place the item from behind your puppy.\n\nPuppies grow fast, so keep an eye on the collar size and loosen it when necessary.",

Once that’s happening with ease, start to call your puppy’s name and encourage them to follow you.\n\nDo any number of foolish things to pique your puppy’s interest. When they start following you, reward them by placing the treats on the floor and saying “Find It-Follow.”\n\nIf your puppy actively resists following you, don’t run over to them; doing that reinforces the resistance. Instead, wave rewards or lower yourself to the floor while you praise them.\n\nThroughout your puppy’s life, they’ll be prodded, pinched, and probed for good (though unclear to them) reasons. To get your puppy used to all of life’s surprises, practice the handling exercises in this section early and often. No one would wish a cut on a puppy’s paw, a burn from an electrical cord, or a double ear infection, but these things do happen, and it helps to get your puppy prepared.

Use household objects to pretend with or scare up a toy doc- tor’s kit as you gently give your puppy make-believe shots, look in their ears and eyes, probe their belly, and so on.

Handle and touch your puppy’s paws daily to ensure that future nail clipping, routine check-ups (for thorns or cuts after adventuring), and any future medical care their paws might need is a non-issue.\n\nA brand-new puppy is easy to condition and socialize because they’re unsure of themselves and how best to react to new situations. Most puppies look to their people to direct and translate new situations. How you greet and interact with people from all walks of life are their greatest examples.\n\nWhen welcoming new visitors, allow your puppy to approach them on their terms rather than thrust them forward or lift them excitedly. If your puppy is unsure, let them hang back, and encourage your visitors to wait for them to approach them.\n\nOf course, the best lesson in appropriate greeting manners comes from you. Mom was right again when she said, “Good manners start at home.” When greeting your puppy, be casual. Even though you may be beside yourself with delight, stay calm and interact with your puppy only when they’re calm, too.\n\nAs the weeks pass, your puppy will feel more a part of your household and be more interactive when new situations arise. If your puppy begins to jump or mouth you or your company, kneel next to them and brace them by clipping your thumb gen- tly under their collar. (See Chapter 9 for an illustration.) Steady them on all four paws whether you’re greeting them or someone is approaching you. Give the command Say hello as you or the admirer offer pats or treats.",

Also, ask the person to approach them from the side or to kneel.

You’re not alone. Before you leash, er, lash out, however, remember that your puppy isn’t capable of trans- lating your anger into a meaningful lesson. Your reactions only teach them to be wary of your moods, something that makes their behavior worse by the hour. Studies show that puppies who fear retaliation chew and nip more, and often mis- behave when their people are out of the room or not watching them.

During this stage, puppies are beginning to recognize what behaviors get your attention, what games seem to last the longest (and not necessarily the games you want to play), and who’s organizing the day-to-day interactions — in their eyes, it may not be you. Even though your puppy may act pretty confident during this phase, they still need direction from you. The advice in this chapter can help you guide your puppy successfully through their preadolescence.\n\nPuppies emerge from their sleepy, early brain-growth phase with eagerness and enthusiasm for all of life’s many adventures. Your efforts will boil down to helping your puppy understand where to go and what to do in every situation. Say you’re\n\nsitting at the table or texting a friend or welcoming a visitor or waiting your turn at the vet’s office: Where should your puppy go and what should they do? How about when they’re bored or hungry or wants to play? If you don’t direct them, they’ll test out all the typical preadolescent shenanigans, including jumping, nip- ping, barking, and grabbing-’n’-going. It can be an utter nightmare.\n\nFortunately, this chapter provides a happy alternative to this type of nightmare. If you follow my advice here, you’ll end up surviving — and maybe even enjoying — your puppy’s preadolescence. With my tried-and-true sequencing approach, you’ll be able to introduce your puppy to three cues at a time. You’ll then be able to use those words to help your puppy understand where to go and what to do in every situation.",

    "page_content": "As you’re training your puppy and introducing new words into their vocabulary, make it fun. Your puppy will cherish their time with you, and lessons that help them identify words and end with rewards build a positive team spirit.\n\nBecause your preadolescent puppy has neither the attention span nor impulse control of a 7-month-old dog, the lessons in this chapter are tailored to meet your puppy’s capacities at the 14-weeks-to-6-months stage. Taken altogether, they allow your puppy to be successful, mastering each direction before you start applying it to their daily routine — similar to letting children master their addi- tion skills in school before asking them to balance your checkbook.\n\nPuppies, like kids, love plunging into group activities. The behavior they repeat is determined by what gets your attention, so focus only on the routines you want your puppy to repeat. Is your puppy over on their mat, chewing a bone? Stand up — quick! Race over and reward them for doing just that.\n\nI suggest that you practice each of the lessons outlined in this chapter twice daily for five to ten minutes per lesson (shorter lessons for younger puppies). As you practice, you may notice that your puppy picks up some directions faster than others. Don’t be too surprised. That’s how training usually goes. After all, think of what you’re accomplishing: You’re teaching another species your language. My advice is to be patient throughout the many phases because puppies learn best from an understanding teacher.",

(More about walkabouts later in this chapter.) As they grow more comfortable with your surroundings, rather than burst out of their confinement and barrel through your home — grabbing every roll of toilet paper, stuffed animal, or sock they find in their way — you may gradually trust them with more freedom. Don’t rush it, though. If they do well for the most part but falls apart when company arrives, put them on the leash whenever you have visitors.\n\nAt this stage, your puppy should feel pretty confident in knowing where to go to get their basic needs met (eat, drink, sleep, potty, and play). If you’ve not outlined these routines, review the Needs Chart (Table 6-2) from Chapter 6 and the tips in Chapter 10. During preadolescence, however, your puppy will be far more interested in how they fit into the fabric of your everyday life. If you don’t tell them where to go and what to do, they will turn your life upside down by making their own set of rules — and that’s a nightmare I wouldn’t wish on anybody.\n\nAs your puppy is developing, both physically and mentally, you need to start teaching the following useful directions: Follow, Sit, Down, Stand Still, Stay, and Come. Though you may have already started some of these lessons, continue rein- forcing them throughout your puppy’s development. Build your lessons around their regular nap times (in the middle of the day), and don’t forget to intersperse the lessons with plenty of play and socialization.",

Because playtime is every puppy’s top priority during this stage, the following list highlights which directions to use during each game. (To find instructions on how to play a particular game, flip to Chapter 20.)\n\n» Can’t Catch Me: Use your puppy’s name to attract their attention as you’re running away from them, and use the directions Wait and Find It when you stop abruptly to reward them. If your puppy jumps up, lift the treat high above their head until they are standing securely on all four paws.\n\n» Get Your Toy: When playing with your puppy’s toys, gather multiples so that you are never caught focusing on just one. Toss one toy, saying “Get Your Toy” and cheering your puppy on if they run after the toy. If your puppy returns to you, pair the cue \"Bring\" with their delivery, but don’t reach out or immedi- ately demand that they fork it over to you: Remember, puppies like kids need to learn how to share! If you can inspire their sharing the toy by offering a treat or baiting them with a new toy so they spit out the one they’re holding, say Give as they spit it out.\n\n» Belly Up: Anytime your puppy naturally lies down, say Down.

To control their exuberance, or to help your puppy should a sudden noise or activity startle them, get a handle on these lessons as soon as you’re able.\n\nYour puppy’s ability to hold still for any length of time depends on their age as well as on how you introduce this lesson. At first, keep the lessons short and completely food-centered as you practice in a low-commotion environment. Work with your puppy off-leash or on a light freedom line if they’re easily distracted. Practice at a time when they are neither exhausted nor ready for play — it’s what I call the sweet spot of ideal focus. (All I can say is that you’ll know it when you find it.) Read the steps in the following sections, and visualize the exercise before getting started.\n\nAll puppies are born posturing, and they focus quickly on learning by way of signs and gestures. Though you’ll want to teach your puppy to listen for your direction, using sig- nals to reinforce your words can speed the learning along. As a bonus? A puppy who learns to read signals may watch you more attentively.\n\nDirect your signals just above your puppy’s nose or muzzle. Here are the signals you use in this chapter:",

With a home full of pets and people, Wait is one word we use a lot.\n\nTeaching your puppy new words and routines can be fast and fun when using the sequencing method, which introduces three interlaced behaviors at once instead of just one at a time. Why three? Well, one is too few, and two is predictable — your puppy will naturally vacillate between the two behaviors without concentrating on what you’re saying — but three is the perfect challenge. Watch as your puppy slows their reactions to tune in to what you’re saying so that they can get it right.\n\nPractice one sequence per 5-minute lesson, and no more than two different sequences each day. Once your puppy is showing an understanding of words, you may bring the sequence out of lesson time and begin to use them in your daily interactions.\n\nOrganize your lessons in a quiet room or area. Treats are essential, so bring those along too — or a toy, if your puppy prefers it. The leash is purely optional at this stage.",

You and your puppy will have fun learning this quick sequence.\n\nInitially, practice luring your puppy one behavior at a time. Remember to practice after a potty-and-play routine when your puppy is neither too sleepy nor too worked up to focus on learning something new.\n\nWhen doing Sit-Down-Stand, avoid ramming your puppy into position with your free hand. At best, you’ll get them there, although they won’t learn to do it for themselves; at worst, you’ll frighten them and they’ll grow more cautious during lesson time.\n\n1. Sit: Hold the treat from your puppy’s nose, bringing it to a point directly above their ears. As they sit, say Sit.\n\n2. Down: Hold the treat from your puppy’s nose, drawing it straight down to a spot directly between their paws. When they lie down, say Down. (See Figure 11-2.)\n\n3. Stand: Hold the treat from your puppy’s nose, drawing it out in a line directly in front of their eye, or if they are lying down, draw it at a slightly upward angle in front of their face. (See Figure 11-3)\n\nYour puppy may have an easier time learning one skill than another: That’s com- mon. Or, you may feel like you’re not able to move your puppy from one position to another without physically pushing them along with your free hand. Ideally, give your puppy time (sometimes it takes 30 seconds) to move into each position on their own. After the lightbulb goes off — this position works to get the treat — they will more quickly assume it the next time around.

Walk forward in a straight line, say- ing Follow as you do. If your puppy jumps ahead or on you, stop and lift the reward\n\nout of their reach. Start again when they calm down. After three to five steps, say Wait as you come to a stop.

If they continue to jump at you, ask a helper to hold the line loosely and to tug it downward should your puppy leap up.\n\nCome is one of the first directions all puppies should know.

Mix it up and reward your puppy at various points along the way.\n\nWhen you see good behavior that you want to reward, be careful how you mark the moment. Saying Good Dog! repetitively in a high-pitched tone may create so much excitement that your puppy may abandon their good behavior for something more recreational, such as nipping or jumping. Instead of lots of verbal praise, if you’re using a clicker, click before you treat. (See Chapter 5 for more on clickers.) If you’re not using a clicker, use a sharp, marking word like Yes or Good to highlight the exact behavior you want your puppy to repeat.\n\nTurning your young puppy free in your home, even if they’ve been doing well with their potty training, is a big mistake. They’ll misbehave and you’ll end up paying for it — in more ways than one. Unsupervised, a puppy can rearrange your closets, eat garbage, and chew on the chairs.\n\nIf your end game is to teach your puppy how to be free in your home, however, this is an ideal time to get started.\n\nOnce or twice a day, lead your puppy through your home on-leash.

Direct with the familiar words Follow, Wait, Sit, Place, and Leave It that you’ve been teaching them and reward their cooperation with treats and praise.\n\n» Speak directions clearly, and enunciate syllables. Also, give directions only once; repeated directions sound drastically different from single directions. (Consider the indecipherable “Sitsitsitcomeonpleasesitdown.”)\n\n» If you’re sitting, arrange a place for your puppy and settle them with a\n\nchew. If they can settle down, keep them with you.\n\nWhen your puppy gets into a routine in your home, you can test their self-control and cooperation by letting them drag a freedom leash as described in Chapter 5. Use your words and signals to direct them, guide them to their stations if you want them to be still, and pick up the lead if they get rambunctious or needs reminding.\n\nEstablishing a special place in the rooms you share\n\nAll puppies love to follow their families, and, when given a choice, yours will always want to be near you. Too much isolation is a bad thing because a puppy gleans their personality from group reflection. When possible, teach your puppy their special place in each of the rooms you share so that they can hang with you wherever you are in your home. If your puppy is still working on their house- training or instigates mayhem when given too much freedom, either walk them on a leash or tether them, as shown in Figure 11-4.",

    "page_content": "Your puppy must be fully comfortable on a leash and at least 12 weeks old before you begin tethering them. Until this age, most puppies feel frantically trapped on a leash and need more sleep than active training. Before then, supervision, crate time, and safe-room freedom are best.\n\nFIGURE 11-4: Tether when you can supervise and teach Stay.\n\nDetermining how long you can keep your puppy tethered to their special place depends on their age and mental state at the time. A sleepyhead of any age can handle an hour or more, and an older pup can handle more extended periods. The best gauge is your puppy’s behavior — always keep them tethered near you and be aware of their signals. If your pup has been resting by you for an hour and sud- denly stands up and starts acting restless, they probably need to go to their potty spot. If your puppy chews on a bone for 15 minutes and then starts acting like a jumping bean, they’re likely experiencing an energy spurt and needs time for a little play.\n\nWhen creating tethers for your puppy, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select a station area in each room you share — perhaps a spot near the couch in the TV room but away from the table in the dining room.\n\nPuppies fidget, so make sure the station is away from stairs, electrical cords and outlets, and other entanglements.\n\n2. Set up the area with a comfy mat and your puppy’s favorite chew toy.\n\nDoing so helps them identify their special place — their comfort station. Think of the comfort station in human terms: When you go into your living room, don’t you have a favorite couch or chair?",

Though Chapter 17 addresses grooming tips and techniques, I thought I should stress at least once in this chapter the importance of conditioning your puppy to their grooming tools now — the sooner you get started, the more they will link their sprucing to food and fun.\n\nHere are three tools to introduce your puppy to. Use favorite chews, spreadable treats, and high-value food rewards to get your puppy acclimated to their use:\n\n» Toothbrush: Organize a routine around the tooth-brushing event to build\n\nexcitement for the activity. I always brush each of our dog’s teeth separately in the small downstairs bathroom to build up eagerness for each turn.\n\nSandwich a dab of safely formulated doggie paste between your chosen brush and a high-value food treat. Say Pearly Whites as you extend the brush to your puppy. After they alert to the routine, continue to play the game for a few more days, slowly diminishing the size of the food treat. Ask a partner to steady your puppy’s head by holding a treat to their nose as you get them comfortable having the brush rotated in their mouth.\n\n» Nail and hair clippers: This is an excellent time to get your puppy used to the\n\nsound of any future clipping tools you or your groomer will use in your puppy’s lifetime. It bears repeating that preadolescent puppies are more receptive to noises as well as to any handling or unfamiliar physical interac- tions than at any other time in their lives. Pairing handling with positive outcomes becomes forever lodged in the area of their brain labeled It Must Be Okay Just Because It Leads to Something Good.",

Repeat this activity with the other grooming tools.\n\n» Grooming brushes: Whatever your puppy’s coat type, assemble the brushes, shedding blades, or combs you’ll need during this stage. Condition your puppy to their presence as outlined with the clipper, but extend the practice to gently touching their coat. Remember to reward them after you remove the object. Gradually comb through their coat, removing the object often to reward their cooperation.\n\nYour puppy “sees” the world through their sense of smell, so let them sniff every- thing that comes near their body.

Puberty, which hap- pens during the teenage stage, results in the release of adult dog hormones that dramatically shape and modify your puppy’s mannerisms.

Oh, the things you have to look forward to.\n\nBefore your puppy strays too far off course, make a list of all the good puppy man- ners you expect from your darling and share it with friends and family.

(Whew!) Life is hard and confusing for them now; they’re easily distracted. Sometimes all it takes is a gentle reminder; at other times, maybe you need two or three. No matter how often t has to occur, calmly insist on what puppy needs to do with stationary directions like Sit, Stay, and Down.",

Calmly repeat yourself even if your puppy is distracted, insisting that listening to you is a requirement, not an option.\n\nOne particular situation needs a firm hand — handling a runaway puppy. If your puppy is off-leash in an unconfined area and you feel that you must go to them, walk at an angle to a point ten feet away from where they’re standing. If you have treats or a treat cup, make a big fuss about eating the treats yourself. (Your puppy has no idea that you won’t actually do it.) Avoid walking straight at your puppy as they may interpret your direct approach as a game. If your puppy approaches you, calmly cast treats on the ground or floor and play Find It. Then calmly hold their collar or attach a leash.\n\nAfter you have your puppy back on-leash, review the lesson they ignored, and practice on-leash lessons for five or ten minutes every day for one week. Remind- ers are often all they need.\n\nIf your puppy continues to ignore a stationary command like Sit or Down, review that one as well.\n\nMany puppy parents dole out No as if it were their puppy’s middle name. More often than not, though, people use the word No inconsistently, which tends to leave puppies baffled about its meaning. It should mean Leave It or Stop — an instructional cue, not a discipline per se. You don’t want your puppy to ever see you as a venting machine. You’re the one who is too cool to blow your lid. If you want your puppy to respond appropriately to this type of cue, avoid the following mistakes:",

Since No is used frequently, we’ll use a softer version, Nope, through the training lessons in the following sections.\n\nYour puppy will get pretty creative as they mature, testing out new behaviors and revisiting a few old habits before they’re all grown up. Though a whiny, couch- cozying, slipper-chewing, garbage-grabbing puppy can look completely inno- cent, and it’s hard to resist laughing the first time your puppy streaks by with that roll of toilet paper unfurling behind them, if you let anything slide twice, your puppy may have a new habit in the making.

Release them with “Okay” and always remember to praise your good puppy.\n\nPractice Come three times per session. That’s all. More than that is stressful for your pup.\n\nIf your puppy gets excited when they hear “Come,” you’re doing a good job. Now you can start encouraging focus around everyday distractions and increasing the distance from which you call them. Use the leash, freedom line, or retractable leash. Instead of putting your puppy from a Sit-Stay, wait for them to get dis- tracted. Stand behind them and call “[Name], come!” If they don’t look to you, tug the leash and use rewards and praise to entice them. You may also run away from them a short distance before turning and welcoming them into your arms.\n\nIf you’re having trouble getting your puppy’s attention around distractions, you’re not alone. Keep practicing, but start in a lower distraction area so that you can build your puppy’s success rate — and yours, too.\n\nHere are a few things to remember when teaching the Come direction:\n\n» Do use it sparingly. When you overuse Come, dogs stop paying attention.\n\nWhen your puppy understands the direction, avoid using it all the time. Say it infrequently and make it extremely rewarding.

Using the Come direction when you want to bring your pup inside makes it a negative direction. Instead, pick a direction like Inside. Start using it on-lead when bringing your puppy into the house. Quickly offer a treat or ball toss.\n\nAnd here’s a list of don’ts — be sure to follow them:\n\n» Don’t chase your puppy if they don’t respond. Practice on-lead for now or\n\nuse a long line to give them more freedom to explore.\n\n» Don’t call for negative interaction. Do you have to brush, bathe, or isolate your puppy? If so, don’t use Come. Also, avoid using it when you’re angry. You’ll only freak your puppy out.\n\n» Don’t repeatedly call or discipline your puppy when they run away. I know the frustration of marching around in the middle of a cold, wet, rainy night looking for your puppy, but if you call or discipline your puppy, you’re only teaching them to run from you.\n\n» Don’t discipline your puppy when they return to you. They won’t come\n\nOnce your puppy recognizes that the word “Nope” means stop whatever their doing, you can begin to practice it around distractions. Use it on your walks and when adventuring on the freedom line. If, say, you instruct Follow and your puppy sticks their head in a bush, say “Nope,” tug the line, and then remind them again to Follow. If you call your puppy on the freedom line and they give you one of the Looks — the In-a-Minute look, for example — say “Nope,” tug the line, and call them again — remembering to look to the ground or call them as you run in the other direction!",

Sit is not optional.\n\nContinue to work on the Down direction even in situations where lying down might be the furthest thing from your puppy’s mind.

Initially use food to urge your puppy’s cooperation in distracting areas, slowly phasing out rewards as your puppy is more reliably listening to you. For tips on learning this cue, flip to the sequencing section of Chapter 11.\n\nWhen your puppy begins cooperating, use Down for everything, such as before treating (hold the treat to the ground and direct Down) and before dinner (cover the bowl with your hand and, as you put it down, say “Down”).\n\nTo teach your puppy Leave It at a distance and out in the real world, set up six to ten different situations — a maximum of one or two for each day, as this lesson is stressful.

Since then, however, the equations have gotten a little more complicated. It turns out that puppies mature a lot during their first couple of years and then slow down considerably as they grow older. A quick search online (type “age equivalents in dogs”) will show the lifespan of a dog and their age equivalent, which varies even more, depending on your puppy’s size. Suffice it to say that simple math won’t help you here.\n\nThe good news for you is that all the drama of your puppy’s growth and emotional development should pass in a year instead of the decades it takes human kids to grow up. If you’ve done your work together as outlined in the other training chapters of Part 3, you’ll be able to communicate with your puppy using the words they know and routines that should be habituated by this stage. If you’re jumping into the book here, flip back to Chapters 10 and 11 to start your lessons off on the right paw!\n\nMagic happens if you routinely train your puppy through the various stages of learning. In addition to watching your puppy’s awareness grow, you will witness habits take form. Your puppy sits at the door because that’s what they’ve always done; they ring a bell when they need to potty, because that’s just the order of events, they drop the ball, fetch a toy when greeting, whip their head around when you call because it’s, well, that’s just how life works.

Start there and master those exercises before you begin the ones described below.\n\nWhether your goal is to have your puppy off-lead around the home or to be responsive when you’re on a hike at a park (check the rules to ensure that you’re allowed to take your dog off-leash in a public area), the most considered question is, “How will I know when my puppy and I are ready for off-lead-control train- ing?” Well, there’s no magic age or season or day; readiness is something you gauge by experience. If you practice giving these directions and your pup shows signs of stress (such as licking their lips, hyperactivity, nipping or roughly jump- ing at you, chewing on their freedom lines), they’ve given you a signal to lower your expectations for now. Puppies show readiness with concentrated eye contact and responsiveness that’s quick and cooperative. A puppy has their timetable for preparedness: Off-lead work requires impulse control that emerges anytime between the ages of 6 and 18 months. Read on to get started.\n\nTraining off the leash requires that both you and your puppy be mentally prepared for the challenges you’ll face. Get your game face on, and then prepare your pup.\n\nTo have off-lead control, you must be confident that your puppy will listen. If you’re a bundle of nerves when you let go of the leash, your puppy will know it and\n\nwill become anxious and unresponsive. Puppies, like people, are drawn to confidence, so you need to act with authority and self-assurance even if you have to fake it.",

Work in a confined area or let your puppy drag a freedom line so that you can ignore or redirect your puppy when they act up.\n\n» Allow one step back for two steps forward. Your puppy is responding beautifully off-lead . . . until someone rings the doorbell, a chipmunk runs across the driveway, or another dog comes trotting past the gate. Then everything they’ve learned goes out the window and you’re back to being ignored. Let me tell you a secret: Off-lead control takes time. If your puppy is good but is still having trouble in a stimulating situation, review on-lead exercises in distracting environments. (See Chapter 12.) Using a freedom line helps control the situation and at the same time conditions more appropriate behavior.\n\nSo, what goes into making your pup mentally ready? Maturity serves your off-lead goals well. As your puppy passes into doghood, you’ll note calm predictability. Wanderlust and mischief will have most likely lost their thrill. Your dog’s joy will manifest itself in silent teamwork and shared activities.

For example, a terrier, who was bred to follow their hunting instincts indepen- dently, is far less impressed with your direction than a Shetland sheepdog, who lives for the camaraderie and guidance of a shepherd. Hounds and Nordic breeds are other pups who must be monitored closely because their instincts can override your direction. Do some research to discover whether your puppy’s breed was bred to work in concert with people or to work independently. Independent thinkers may need more persuasion to focus. (A clicker and some food can work wonders.) With an independent thinker, understand that 100 percent reliability may not be a realistic goal.\n\nBuying the Right Equipment — and Using It Correctly\n\nAs you work toward off-lead obedience, you’ll practice exercises that extend your control over greater and greater distances. Before you start, however, you should round up the following items (each of which is discussed in more detail later in this section):\n\n» Retractable leash: The retractable leash is invaluable for advanced\n\n» Indoor freedom line: This item is a light, 4-foot leash worn around the house. » Finger lead: This lead, shown in Figure 13-1, should be long enough to gently guide but short enough not to distract your dog (1 to 6 inches is a common length).\n\n» Tether-n-train: This type of leash, with a clip on each end (see Figure 13-2) teaches your pup to walk beside you. You can also use this leash outside to tether your puppy to an immovable object (such as a tree or bench) to practice distance Stay directions.

Stand by the line and give a direction (Sit, Down, Wait, or Come). If your pup is too preoccupied, you may need to go back a step and lure them into position with food or a favorite toy. Your puppy may have generalized that \"sit\" and \"down\" only count in the kitchen alone. Once you’ve practiced this new out-of-lesson format, phase off luring, lest you become treat dependent. Now if your puppy looks at you, walk closer to their side and repeat the direction. For example, if you give the direction, Down, and your puppy gives you a blank stare, step on the line to stop them, and then repeat both the word cue and the associated hand signal. (For more on hand signals, see Chap- ter 11.) It’s not uncommon to give the directions two or three times when you move from on-leash to off-leash directions. Your patience can help them over- come their off-leash confusion. Praise your dog when they’re cooperating.\n\nAfter your puppy has proven to be reliable on the freedom line, use a short lead to reinforce your stationary directions: Sit, Stay, Down, Wait, Follow, and Come. (Refer to Chapters 11 and 12 for more on these directions.) The short lead adds weight to their collar, reminding them of the security of on-lead direction as well as giving you the ability to guide them calmly if they get confused.\n\nIn addition to using the short lead around the house, do one of their standard les- sons once a day. Bring your puppy into a quiet room and practice a simple direc- tional routine. Initially hold the short lead, but then drop it after you’ve warmed up. Slap your leg and use hand signals and peppy body language to encourage your dog’s focus.",

Stop your puppy next to a tree or another stable object you can secure the leash to (as shown in Figure 13-3).\n\nFIGURE 13-3: Secure your puppy to a tree or another immovable object to begin practicing distance commands.\n\n4. After you direct your puppy to “Stay,” walk ten feet away.\n\nExtend your distance as they gain control. Run your fingers through your hair and swing your arms gently back and forth to emphasize that the leash is out of your hands.\n\n5. As your puppy improves, practice a Sit-Stay and duck out of sight, practice Down from a Sit-Stay, or practice a distance Down-Stay.\n\nIf your puppy disobeys, determine whether their response is motivated by anxiety, confusion, or disrespect. If they’re confused or anxious, their posture will shrink, their tail will lower, and both their eyes and ears will flicker distressfully. Don’t issue a correction: Doing so may only create more stress when you’re separated. Calmly return to their side and reposition them gently. Repeat the exercise at close range. If its disrespect, review your role and review earlier lessons to build your partnership.\n\nIf your puppy gets overexcited or breaks from the position when you return, try the walking-in-backward trick. Holding a distance Stay is hard work — many dogs feel stressed when they can’t see you and pop up when you finally return. If this sounds like your situation, walk back to your puppy backward. Wait until you’ve released your puppy from a stay to make eye contact and praise them!",

Both warrant gauging whether your goal is to enjoy this time together. A radically excitable puppy finds it difficult to focus when distractions mount and will likely dart away if not taught better impulse control. On the other hand, a puppy who is nervous when you’re out of sight won’t enjoy the splendor of an off-lead stroll and may react inappropriately to passersby. Keeping your puppy focused on you, regardless of their personality or the situation, is the key to happy off-lead experiences.\n\nSome puppies can’t get enough of life! Social, curious, and outgoing, excitable explorer puppies race about, trying to take in every new stimulus. Before practic- ing an off-lead exercise with your excitable explorer, tire them out a bit. Play games (indoors or out) that don’t require strict conformity to detail. Soda Bottle Soccer and Two-Toy Toss (see Chapter 20) are wonderful options. At first, prac- tice your lessons before your puppy’s meals, using either their kibbles or special treats to enhance their focus and cooperation. A clicker (flip to Chapter 5) can often add a spark to lessons as well. If your puppy is too excited to respond, prac- tice on-lead for half the lesson or return to the basics for a few more weeks.\n\nIf your dog is cautious, they’ll be less inclined to romp when you unclip the leash. Their tail may immediately attach itself to their underside, their ears may pin back, and their eyes may dart around, looking for a familiar place to hide.",

The goal is to help your puppy have faith in your presence and your direction. Try the following tips to get your pup to have faith in your direction:\n\n» Increase your use of visual hand signals. » Use a treat cup or a click-and-treat combination (provided that the sound of the clicker doesn’t startle your puppy) to alert your puppy and reward their cooperation.\n\n» Respond in ways that pique their curiosity, such as playing with a stick or toy\n\n» Instead of simply unclipping the freedom Line, shorten it by slowly snipping away at it, one inch at a time. Some puppies like the feel of the leash and prefer it to running “naked!”\n\nDo you know that your puppy can read you as well as — or maybe even better than — you can read them? If your timing is off by a hair or your mind is drifting, they’ll notice and may modify their cooperation. If you feel that your puppy’s testing you, you may be on to something, but their resistance is caused less by disrespect than by their interest in learning the rules of this new off-lead game. Practice the lesson only when you can be mindful to detail, and use a freedom line to prevent any mishaps. In case your puppy becomes genuinely out of control, have a few backup plans, such as running to the car, faking a tremendous accident, or shaking a treat cup. Be positive when reunited so that your puppy doesn’t lose faith in your reconnection.",

The emer- gency Down is a high-octane version of the Down direction that’ll have your puppy hitting the dirt mid-pace. It can be a real lifesaver. I used it to stop one of my puppies who broke their Stay to greet my husband, who was walking home across a busy street.\n\nIn the beginning, your puppy may be a little confused, so be patient and positive throughout their training sessions. Don’t start practicing this exercise until your puppy has mastered the Down direction. (See Chapter 11.) To teach your pup the emergency Down, follow these steps:\n\n1. Stand next to your unsuspecting puppy. 2. Suddenly direct “Down” in an urgent tone as you kneel or bend and point toward the ground, as shown in Figure 13-5.\n\nUse the type of tone you’d use if a loved one were about to walk off a cliff.\n\n3. Tap the ground and repeat Down if they look confused. 4. Act like you’re being bombed, too, by kneeling next to your pup.\n\nIf your puppy needs a food lure initially, go ahead and use one, but phase off within five repetitions to avoid treat dependence. Soon, your puppy will catch on. After they do, begin extending your distance from them as you direct “Down” in your most urgent tone.\n\nFIGURE 13-5: The emergency Down can save your dog’s life.\n\nIt’s true — the emergency Down really does save lives. Once I was leaving my training classes with my husky, Kyia, when a tennis ball slipped loose and started rolling toward the road. Kyia, the sweet thing, wanted to help and ran innocently to collect it. In a panic, I shouted “Down!” and she dropped like a rock. What a good girl!",

Many things can happen: your puppy may get confused, or see a friend, or see a squirrel, child, or cat. Many young dogs test their people’s reactions by turning into an instant comedian and bounding away from you just for fun. So practice all initial training in an enclosed area. Keep the situation safe until they’re both mature and reliable. It is never wise to walk a dog near a roadway off leash: don’t do it, no matter how confident you are in your puppy’s reliability.\n\nYou may be wondering many things about OLT at this point. Here’s a list of ques- tions that I’m asked most often:\n\n» When will I know I can trust my dog off-lead? You should feel it. This road is never smooth in the beginning; some days you get a quick and happy response; other days feel more like your first lessons together. Stay cool, though — frustration is a sign of weakness, and you can quickly lose your dog’s respect. You’ll gradually notice your dog’s hesitation diminish. They’ll respond happily and without consideration, and you’ll get a fluid feeling that they enjoy being near you and listening to you. Until this point, keep your puppy in an enclosed area or dragging a freedom line as you practice so that if they start to act cocky, you can retreat immediately. And don’t hesitate to go back to the freedom line or on-lead exercises for a quick review.",

If you hit your dog, you erode your relationship and diminish their off-lead trust. If you’re really angry, walk away calmly. Remember, a graceful retreat is not a failure.\n\n» My puppy breaks every time I leave them in a Stay on their retractable leash. What can I do? Make sure they’re okay with the pull of the leash-pivot in front of them, and then walk forward and — because they may respond to the tug of the leash — remind them to stay. Then increase your distance slowly. For example, if your puppy gets up every time you walk out 15 feet, practice at 10 feet for a week, and then at 11 feet and 12 feet, and so on. » Sometimes my dog crouches and barks at me. How can I make them stop? Don’t look at them. They’re trying to turn all your hard work into a game. Ignore them until their antics subside.

When two dogs meet in an open space, they’ll gen- erally race at an angle to one another and circle, assessing who should organize the interaction. After they’ve established their roles, the dogs will get along unless human interference stresses the situation.\n\nAbnormal greeting: Dogs don’t charge directly at one another unless they’re pre- paring to fight. A face-to-face, chest-to-chest, direct-eye-contact approach is friendly only if you’re a person — dogs view it as an attack. Dogs generally attack one another only if they’re defending their young or protecting their territory. When this type of confrontation occurs, the only hope may be for the other dog to lie still in complete submission or turn and run away, which may or may not happen. If you have any control over the outcome, leave immediately.\n\nA well-behaved dog is a welcome social guest, a plus at parades and picnics, and an added fan at after-school sporting events.

Sit on the edge of a chair with your legs bent in front of you. 2. Wave a treat to lure your puppy. 3.

However, you need to teach them impulse control or else they may dart headlong into traffic or rush an unfriendly candidate.\n\nBefore you rush up to every dog you see, stop and ask yourself whether the dog is friendly and the people are open to greeting. If you think they are, gain control of your puppy to ensure that the interaction goes smoothly. Do not approach dogs who are barking, jumping, or out of control: This type of dog is overwhelming to both dogs and people.\n\nBefore approaching a friendly, well-mannered dog, gain control of the situation by following these steps:\n\n1. If your puppy acts excited, bring them Back and encourage them to Wait. 2. Ask the person to wait to approach you until after your puppy has calmed down.\n\n3. After you have your puppy under control, you can permit a greeting by saying, “Okay, go play.”\n\n4. When playtime is over, instruct your puppy to Follow and move on. 5. Use rewards and praise to encourage them to leave the other dog alone and focus on you. 6. Keep working on it.\n\nGetting your puppy in control around new dogs and people can take a while.\n\nPuppies love playdates as much as kids do! If your friend or neighbor has a dog- friendly dog or another puppy and you want to get the dogs together to play, try to organize a first meeting at a neutral location, such as an empty playground or field. (Doing so prevents territorial reactions.) When possible, give both dogs freedom to interact on a freedom line (see Chapter 5), because choking up on a short leash can prompt containment aggression.",

If you let frustration creep in, however, your tension will stress your puppy out: Corrections teach your puppy to avoid you when they need to potty, both inside and out.\n\nThe first step in house-training your puppy is to choose the elimination area. Your goal is to teach them to leave their living spaces to go to the bathroom, so decide whether you want that place to be indoors or outdoors. Papers should be neatly arranged in the far corner of a room or pen, away from food and water dishes and gradually shimmied to an out-of-the-way bathroom or mudroom where your adult dog will go for privacy. Outdoors, choose the surface first: Do you want your puppy going on mulch, grass, or pavement, for example? Once that’s decided, choose or create a place by putting down, say, mulch — initially just 10 to 20 feet from the door to help your puppy stay focused on the goal of your outings. Take your puppy to the toilet area on a 6-foot leash and wait until they potty to pet, play, or walk them.\n\nBecause eliminating puts puppies in a vulnerable position, privacy is best. Choose a spot that is discrete, whether indoors or outdoors. Like people, dogs don’t like to potty out in the open, nor should they get in the habit of wandering about to find their ideal elimination spot.\n\nAlthough I find training a dog to go outside makes the most long-term sense, city people often have to start out with paper training until their puppy has received their vaccines. You may also want to choose paper training over taking your dog outside if you have a small dog or an indoor lifestyle. Whatever you choose, many of the same rules apply:",

This scenario is ideal for working parents or for zones that are hit with extreme weather patterns. (House-training a husky in the middle of winter may not present problems, but getting your teacup Chihuahua to pid- dle in subzero frost just isn’t going to happen.)\n\nThis cross-training option is slightly more challenging for your pup to comprehend, but any routine can be learned as long as you’re consistent. Just be clear on your expectations — that they potty on paper when you’re out of the house or during inclement weather and outside at all other times. Here are some suggestions for cross-training:\n\nEstablish a routine for going outside when you’re home and in all but extreme weather.\n\nGet your puppy to ring a bell to alert you when they need to go (see the section “Helping Your Pup Communicate Their Need to Go,” later in this chapter), and rou- tinely take them to a predetermined spot near the door or exit.\n\nWhen you’re not home, secure your puppy in a small room or playpen with papers or pads. Calmly remove the pads when you return home, clean them in front of your puppy to reinforce eliminating in the right place, and then return to business as usual. Keep your puppy confined near you if they try to venture off to potty elsewhere in the house.",

Puppies, on the other hand, do other things to signal their need confusion, such as fidgeting, nipping, racing away, or whining.

Even though you teach them a better signal down the road, for now be mindful that a young puppy’s nips may highlight their need to potty. Rather than disciplinie a baby puppy, direct them “Outside!” or to their “Papers!”\n\nTo help your puppy learn to give you a more appropriate signal, consider these suggestions:\n\n» Ring a bell or chime. Secure a bell or chime at your puppy’s nose level,\n\nraising it as they grow. (See Figure 14-2.) Tap the bell just before you go on a bathroom run. If your puppy has access to the door, hang it there so that the sound always indicates an open door. Otherwise, start by hanging it next to the gate, stairway, or banister that encloses their free-play area. Ring the bell for them or with them for a week. If they don’t catch on, discreetly smear butter or cheese on the bell first thing in the morning. When your puppy touches the bell, open the door — voilà.\n\n» Bark near their area. If your puppy is a barker, teach them to bark on cue. As you approach the exit area for a potty outing (door, gate, whatever), encour- age them to Speak (see Chapter 16). When they do, praise them lavishly, and on you go outside. Good puppy!",

At night, a young puppy can sleep at your bedside in a large, open-topped box or secured on a leash to your bedside (after they’re leash trained and comfortable with daytime stations). If they still can’t seem to keep their areas separate, you may need to gate a bathroom and leave papers down. During the day, keep your puppy with you or confine them in a small room, taking them outside or to the papers as often as your schedule will allow (ideally, within a half-hour to 2-hour period).

Here are my quick tips:\n\n» Limit their freedom to a small confinement area. If your puppy is eliminating in little-used corners of your house, they may have too much freedom. Puppies are den animals. Most young or untrained adolescents won’t soil the area right around them, but if they can race upstairs or into an adjacent room outside their “den,” they’re more than happy to relieve themselves there.\n\nKeep your puppy confined in a crate or on a training tether (available online), or use a generic leash to serve the same purpose. A training tether leash can be quickly modified to secure to your waist or to an immovable object in the room you share. Designate an area in each location with a mat and chews so that your puppy can easily occupy themselves if you’re busy.",

Calmly place your puppy in another room or with a family member as you clean it up.\n\n» Neutralize the odor. Your puppy has a very sensitive sniffer. They automati- cally return to areas where their smell is concentrated. Use a pet store formula or a 50-50 mixture of water and vinegar to remove the scent. » Know when corrections count. If you catch your puppy in the process of eliminating in the house, startle them just a little. (Shouting and running at your puppy is way too scary.) Clap your hands as you say, “Ep, ep, ep!” After you’ve interrupted your pup, relax your posture and calmly direct them to the elimination area as if nothing happened. When they’re done, praise your pup for finishing.\n\n» Know when disciplinary actions don’t count. As much as you want to think your pup is human, they aren’t. Your frustration and anger toward your puppy make you look foolish. I’ve heard this claim: “My puppy knows what they did was wrong — you should see the look of guilt on their face.” But the truth is, your puppy doesn’t understand the world in the same way you do.

Sure, you can frighten a puppy into looking guilty, but scaring them won’t teach them anything — except to be leery of you.\n\nIf you catch your pup soiling someplace other than in their designated area, you can interrupt the process, but lay off all other corrections.\n\n» Maintain a stable diet. Avoid changing dog food brands, unless your\n\nveterinarian directs you to do so. Your puppy doesn’t digest food the way you do: Their intestine is small and unable to process and absorb a varied diet. If you must change food, do it slowly, shifting 25% every three days until you have 100% of the new food.\n\n» If your puppy is pooping in the house, lay off constant food treats. If you sporadically give food in any form throughout the day, their elimination habits may be random.\n\n» Watch the water intake. Puppies, especially young ones, drink water\n\nexcessively if they’re bored or nervous. If your pup is having house-training problems, monitor their water intake. Provide water or ice cubes (which absorb faster into their system than water) during mealtimes, just before an outing, and when they pant or go to their bowl.\n\nRegardless of where you live, pick up after your puppy. Stools attract bugs and worms, and stepping in dog poop is gross. Do your part — after all, in the city and many sub- urbs, cleaning up after your dog is the law.

Other forms of discipline are often viewed by your puppy as confrontational play. Instead of calming your puppy during everyday interac- tions, your puppy will grow up doing bothersome things just to feel included. As I point out in Chapter 6, even negative attention (shouting, shoving, glaring) excites a puppy.\n\nFortunately, help is just ahead. You will learn how to encourage different routines, like chewing their objects instead of your furnishings, sitting for attention instead of jumping, and grabbing a bone when they’re excited instead of little Casey’s ponytail. The choice of how your puppy behaves is really up to you.\n\nYour puppy’s misbehavior exists only in your mind. From their perspective, what- ever they’re doing — sock stealing, counter cruising, nipping, digging, barking, or engaging in impulsive greeting rituals — has value and is often just plain fun. Before you can phase out one behavior, consider what you’d rather they do instead. We will explore your options together.\n\nAfter you’re an official puppy parent, your eyes and ears will perk up to any nearby conversation, article, tip, or controversy about dogs. Sometimes you’ll hear unfa- miliar terms — every field has its own jargon.

Place an object or your body in your puppy’s line of vision to calm any reaction.\n\n» Condition: The idea here is to create an association between what’s going on in the environment and your puppy’s reaction to it. Ideally, you’ll condition your puppy to stimulations they’ll experience throughout their life. Sometimes your puppy will condition involuntary (known as classical conditioning), as in their response to the sound of a treat or food bag, and at other times you can condition voluntary responses, like teaching your puppy to sit when they see you holding a toy or food reward. Though you can use conditioning to train your dog chosen habits like sitting instead of jumping, your puppy can also condition bad habits just as quickly.\n\n» Counter-condition: Dogs can be taught new behaviors and routines to\n\ncounter another habit, like lying down or returning to your side when they see another dog on a leash, or sitting or fetching a toy when they hear a doorbell.\n\n» Desensitize: Desensitization involves gradually exposing your puppy to\n\nstimulations, like a noise or dog, that otherwise bring about a strong startle response until they’ve conditioned to its presence without reaction. » Extinguish: This references a way to bring an end to behavior by simply ignoring it. When a puppy barks for attention you can ignore it until the behavior is extinguished.\n\n» Habituate: This term refers to the gradual exposure to a former overstimulat- ing situation until your puppy can redirect or cope with the situation more calmly. A good example is a puppy who is reactive to vacuums being gradually habituated to them.",

You could use mimicking to encourage calmness in situations where your puppy is excited or use cheerfulness if your puppy is cautious of a new dog or person. You can also use mimicry to teach your puppy the meaning of new words like “Upstairs” or “Outside.”\n\nneeds to hire a trainer is that trainers are proactive planners who understand behavior problems without needing to see them in action. Proactive training involves teaching your puppy what to do rather than waiting until your puppy is misbehaving to call attention to the wrong behavior.\n\n» Punishment: Anything that discourages a behavior is known as a punish- ment. Positive punishment adds something that your puppy will want to avoid, like a shock or a shove (although most positive punishments scare your puppy and result in other undesirable behavior, like chewing, self-mutilation,\n\nor avoidance). Negative punishment removes something when an action happens, like lifting a treat out of reach when your puppy jumps.\n\n» Redirect: Redirection involves changing your puppy’s focus from one activity to another activity. By associating words such as their name and phrases like Go Get Your Toy or Can’t Catch Me (see Chapter 20) with a fun activity, you can redirect your puppy when they’re feeling cautious, defensive, or excited, for example when greeting or chasing.",

Many people (including many ineffective trainers) wait until bad behavior occurs to direct or interfere with a puppy’s behavior. Instead of resulting in understanding, reactive responses create a negative behavior loop that strains the relationship between puppy and parent and leads to other annoying rituals like pacing, barking, and self-mutilation.\n\nAvoid anyone who tells you to use battery-operated collars that deliver shocks as a training strategy for your dog — and remember that these collars are illegal in many European countries.\n\n» Reinforce: Anything that encourages a behavior to occur is considered to be reinforcing the behavior. Certain positive reinforcements provide something rewarding to your puppy, like a reward for sitting for treats and toys — ensuring that they’ll repeat the response. On the other hand, negative reinforcements remove a positive aspect, such as covering your face each time your puppy jumps or paws for attention. (Puppies crave face-to-face contact and will adjust their behavior if it is denied them.)\n\n» Socialize: This process involves getting your puppy used to the different\n\nsights, sounds, and stimulations they’ll be exposed to throughout their life. A puppy who isn’t well socialized will have strong, often paralyzing reactions to unfamiliar things.\n\n» Trigger: Anything that stimulates a strong reaction in your puppy is commonly called a trigger. Some sounds or sights or situations will trigger fear, hyperre- activity, or defensiveness in a puppy. Keep track of what triggers your puppy, and work to socialize them to the situation until they’re comfortable with it.",

Just like kids, pups are curious about the world around them, and they love to explore. Kids use their hands to explore, and puppies use their mouths.\n\nAdditionally, pups between 3½ and 11 months old are teething and growing: They start out with a tiny, adorable head filled with 28 little baby teeth, and within a year they end up with a big head filled with 42 adult chompers. During this time, your puppy may chew on the furniture, the walls, or your favorite shoes to allevi- ate discomfort. To ward off possible destruction, supply (and encourage the use of) appropriate chew toys. Get spray deterrents to make your valuables taste bad. In addition, be patient and use some of the tried-and-true techniques described in this subsection to teach your puppy what to chew instead of what not to.\n\nHaving objects scattered all over the floor can confuse your puppy, who may think that everything on the ground belongs in their mouth. Instead, organize a calming station in the rooms you share and place a couple of bones and toys on it or near it in a toy basket.

Any odor or bitter- tasting fluid can be dabbed or sprayed onto the surface to discourage your puppy from mouthing it. Certain store-bought products or household products (like vin- egar or diluted oils) may do the trick. If you notice your puppy chewing on the furniture surrounding their station, coat everything except their bed and bone. Also, if your puppy is chewing household items such as wires or phone cords, say “EP, ep” as you discreetly spray the article. Before you leave the scene, redirect your puppy to their chew toy.\n\nWhen one puppy steals another puppy’s toy or bone, the object’s value increases. The same is true if your puppy grabs something you’d rather they didn’t and you race over to them or chase them to get it back. Instead of teaching the puppy to avoid whatever they’ve just grabbed, you’ve just communicated “Prize envy!” In other words, they’ll consider that whatever they have is valuable because you’re challenging them to get it back. If you make a fuss after they grab it, your puppy thinks, “Wow, what a great prize — everybody wants to take it from me!”",

Pretty scary, no?\n\nYour puppy’s mouth is equivalent to your hands: If your puppy is restless, or ner- vous, they chew. Young puppies live moment to moment just doing whatever comes naturally.

The following system works for puppies at any age, but it’s especially important to teach a young puppy good chewing habits:\n\n» Create a playroom: Place a mat down to rest on and a collection of their toys and chew items. Keep it clean, with no other temptations around. Spend time together teaching them to identify toys and chews by name.\n\n» Take a walkabout: These are planned “walks” round and about your home; use them to condition your puppy where to go to find their place, toys and chews in each room you share. Guide your puppy on a leash, and show them their places in various rooms in the house.

But if it’s the children, cats, or your clothing, well, that’s an issue. Your new goal is to teach the puppy what’s accept- able to grab, pull, and tug at and what’s off limits.\n\nIn Chapter 20, I point out that the teaching Tug and Give simultaneously is critical to developing your puppy’s understanding of when it’s okay to tug on items and when the items have to be released. You may want to check out that chapter before trying out this section’s strategies in your day-to-day interactions with your pup.\n\nIf your puppy is a clothing grabber or a scarf puller or a hair band snatcher, you’ll need to make it crystal-clear that worn objects are off limits. Purchase or make a dog play pole that you can bounce about like a fishing rod as you encourage your puppy to Go Get Your Toy and play Tug-Tug-Give (described in Chapter 20) with their toy. Then fill a small spray bottle with a distasteful spray deterrent and carry it with you when you suspect an assault. Don’t look at your puppy or turn and face them when they jump after your clothes, as they’ll interpret your actions as rough play or confrontational. Without looking at your puppy or responding impulsively, spray your clothing discreetly while your puppy is instigating this interaction and continue walking.\n\nIf the clothes-grabbing problem persists, get help now. It can mature into adult aggression — no joke.",

Because you can’t teach kids and critters to freeze on cue, you need to help your puppy control their impulses. Follow the 3 step program mentioned earlier in this chapter, as it works well here, too.\n\nGet ready for action by putting your puppy on their leash and training collar or harness — ideally, around mealtime so that you can use their food to engage in the following lesson (feeding their food in portions or by hand). Now have your kids role-play — ask them to race around the room and engage in exciting mock play in front of you and your puppy as if you and the puppy weren’t there. (Remind them not to look at the puppy.)\n\nEngage your puppy by luring a lesson (first outlined in Chapters 10) or by playing Find It or another favorite game from Chapter 20.\n\nAnytime your puppy looks, leans, or lunges at the children, either step between them (block) or move in the opposite direction as you redirect them to another diversionary game or activity (refer to Step 2).\n\nAfter you’ve calmed your puppy indoors, repeat this same routine outdoors until they can be together without setting each other off. Refer to the kids-and-puppy section of Chapter 8 for more tips on peacefully raising your kids and puppy together.\n\nFor safety reasons, never leave the puppy and children unattended. Remind the children of the differences between dogs and other kids — namely, that dogs don’t like being hugged, because it makes them feel trapped and threatened and they only stare directly at each other when inviting rough play or a fight. Because kids have poor memories, grown-ups have to be around to remind them.",

There’d be no need — they’d be face-to-face with their pack members, seeing what they see and\n\ndoing whatever they do— bonding, hanging on the couch, checking on the pan- cakes, or slapping a big, friendly wet one right on Aunt Sally’s kisser.\n\nOf course, puppies can’t live their life at that height, so your puppy takes to jump- ing. They jump to greet, explore, and join you in places where you’d rather they not. When you correct them — nudge them off the couch or attempt to repel their 2-legged embrace, they translate your physical interaction as playful, exciting, and interactive. You’re encouraging them with your attention.\n\nPuppies who jump need to learn the 4-paw rule, which means that they don’t get what they want until all four paws are on the floor. For your puppy to understand that the 4-paw rule applies everywhere and with everyone, consistency is a must, so use one of the creative ways spelled out in this chapter to involve your friends and family. Soon you’ll realize that your puppy isn’t the most difficult one to train.\n\nPlace toy baskets by key excitement points, like entranceways and your puppy’s crate so that, when greetings arise, you can direct your puppy to grab their toy or bone first, as I discuss in Chapter 8.\n\nAll puppies want you down on their level. If they can’t figure how to get you down, they’ll come up. Though you may feel frustrated at the moment, any pushing or shoving only encourages more jumping, as most perceive physical corrections as confrontational play. A better solution is to counter-condition your puppy by teaching an alternative behavior, such as the ones in this list:",

If you have a basket of toys by the door or greeting area, direct your puppy to Go Get Your Toy each time there’s a meet-and-greet.\n\n» Dance: Some little dogs are obsessed with hopping around on their hind legs, especially when they’re happy.

    "page_content": "» The peekaboo solution: The most effective solution for an attention jumper is to do the exact opposite of what they’re hoping for: It’s what I call the peekaboo solution. (See Figure 15-3.) The pros would say that we’re solving the problem by extinguishing it. Consider this: If I kept bugging you to play Monopoly and you didn’t look up once, I’d go elsewhere for fun. After your puppy stops jumping, encourage them by saying “Sit” or “Go get your toy!” and then give them attention for that.\n\n» Block: This solution often takes puppies by surprise. Do it gently and without any engagement with your eyes or torso. As your puppy jumps, calmly move your leg or torso into the space their body occupies so that they’re bumped slightly off balance. Even if they try to jump a couple of times, keep moving your leg into their space. When they pause to consider the incident, instruct “Sit\" and praise them.\n\n» Reverse yo-yo: If your puppy’s a real jumper, keep a lead (at least 4’ long)\n\nattached to their collar. When they jump, either step on the leash so that it’s short enough to get them only a few inches off the ground but no higher, or gently pull your puppy sideways. Continue to ignore them as if they weren’t there, giving no eye contact, body language, or verbal corrections until they’ve settled enough to sit calmly.\n\n» Spray away: Also effective when it comes to discouraging eager jumpers is to spray a bitter-tasting deterrent (lemon juice-water, vinegar-water at a 50% mix, or a marketed taste deterrent) between your bodies. Avoid spraying your puppy in the face; spray your clothing instead to create a vapor boundary between you. After your puppy pulls away, refocus their energy to a toy or game.",

Blatant corrections are perceived as prize envy — that you’re coveting whatever’s up there. If your corrections are too pronounced and threatening, you may encourage sneaky behavior such as counter-cruising behind your back. Even though you think your puppy’s grabbing out of spite, they’re not.\n\nThe reason your puppy snatches things off the countertops when your back is turned or you leave the room is that — obviously — they want to avoid being chal- lenged by you. Basically, they’re thinking, “Whatever is on the counter must be great, so I’d better grab it when all backs are turned, or else I’ll have to give it up.”\n\nFollow these steps to get a handle on this issue (a puppy must be six months old to understand this sequence):\n\n1. Place a tempting item on the counter and bring your puppy into the room on-leash.\n\n2. The instant your puppy looks up to sniff the counter, calmly pull back on the leash and say “Leave it.” Next, shame the counter in an admonishing tone, “Shame on the counter!”\n\n3. Continue to work in the kitchen, reminding your puppy to leave it when they look at the countertop then redirecting them to their place and their toy or chew.\n\nIf your puppy’s already stolen something off the counter, try not to be upset. To retrieve the object, call your puppy to you and calmly exchange the item for a treat or toy. Yelling or shoving your puppy after they’re already in possession of some- thing will only reinforce their behavior, ensure they counter-cruise when your back is turned, and guarantee a repeat performance.",

(See Chapter 11 for advice on tethering.)\n\nThere are people who really don’t see any issue with dogs being on the furniture. If you count yourself among them, you have my permission to skip this section. However, some people invite young puppies on the furniture only to regret it dur- ing adolescence when they use the furnishings as a parkour course. If you have a puppy and you don’t want them on your furniture permanently, or you want them to come up by permission only, do yourself a favor and discourage the behavior until they’re eight months old. You can still snuggle anytime, but it’s better to slide down to the floor so that you’re making the choice to come down to their level, versus bringing them up to you.\n\nWhen a client doesn’t want the puppy on the furniture, or they want their puppy only to come up when they say it’s okay, I teach a technique I call level-training. It’s especially important if a puppy struggles with house-training (puppies are more likely to pee on absorbent surfaces), chewing or impulse control. Hopping on the couch and standing eye to eye gives many puppies the impression that it’s playtime. A better approach is to have your puppy stay on their place, looking up to you with parental reverence. As your puppy matures, you can permission-train them, as detailed later in this section.\n\nAlready got a couch hugger? The habit’s not too difficult to break as long as you’re consistent.

Bringing them home is a real culture shock, and suddenly being expected not to mouth is a confusing lesson. Here are some tips to make it easy and fun:\n\nTeach gentle: Instead of teaching your puppy not to mouth you (a losing proposition), teach your puppy to mouth you gently. Relax your hand in your puppy’s mouth and say “Gentle” as long as they’re doing just that.\n\nTeach kisses: Whenever your puppy licks you, say “Kisses” and praise them warmly. Encourage licking by slathering your hands with a frozen stick of butter. Yum! With the butter treat, they’ll gladly lick your hand instead of mouthing it.\n\nTeach YOUCH: When your puppy bites down too hard (which will happen), make a big sudden to-do like you’re hurt, which may not be so hard to pretend, after all. Shout “YOUCH” dramatically, and watch your puppy’s reaction. Some take it to heart, recognizing your pain threshold, and return to gentle mouthing. Other puppies find your theatrics hysterically funny and get even more excited. If your puppy is the latter, don’t try this again, because it’ll only make matters worse.\n\n» Redirect: Puppies generally mouth because they want to be with you. If you substitute a toy for flesh, stay with your puppy as you encourage them to engage in a chew. You can also try these strategies:\n\nCheck your puppy’s needs chart: Needy puppies (hungry or thirsty; tired or wound up; potty-ready) get mouthy.\n\nPlay games. Choose chasing games with multiple toys or a play pole. • Pet your puppy soothingly. Use long strokes, which has a soothing effect on puppies.",

Encourage kisses and give them attention when the lick your hand instead.\n\nSometimes a puppy can go from mouthing gently to nipping: They’re two very different behaviors. Mouthing is loving, nipping is bossy — and it smarts. A nip- ping puppy isn’t a bad puppy.

Have the kids ignore your puppy completely, until they are calmly standing or sitting on all four paws. If the puppy continues to jump, tell the kids to cover their faces with their eyes. Once your puppy is settled, the kids can toss toys or treats at a safe distance!\n\nSpray away. If your puppy persists, try spritzing yourself with bitter apple spray or putting a leash on your puppy so that you can guide them off your body part instead of leaping out of their way.\n\nPurchase several small spray misters to place around your home for handy access. Discreetly hold them in your hand as you spray whatever object your puppy is nipping — clothing, furniture, or body part.\n\nNever stare at your pup while you spritz or spray them. Doing so turns an unpleasant result into a confrontational interaction.\n\nIf your interactions and discouragement don’t calm your puppy’s reactivity, find a professional to help you rehabilitate them.

    "page_content": "Chapter 16 Addressing Extreme Reactions — On and Off the Leash\n\nAs your puppy matures into adolescence, they start taking life far more\n\nseriously. They notice things and respond to unusual sights and sounds. Your pup is now fully aware of comings and goings — yours and everyone else’s. They grow bored with the same old stuff and worrisome when alone. Without your understanding and direction, or if unfairly disciplined for what are, to your puppy, completely normal reactions to life’s uncertainties, their reactive behavior will get worse and not better.\n\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn how to respond and redirect the behaviors that con- cern or aggravate you — like digging, barking, aggression, leash reactivity, and other anxious behavior (especially when left alone). Keep in mind, though, that changing your puppy’s behavior is less about them and more about how you han- dle their reactions to everyday situations. Hyperassertive or soothing approaches generally backfire because they’re more interactive than instructional.\n\nIf you read along and analyze just what might be causing your puppy’s reaction, you can tweak your response. Remember: Everything depends on what you do at the moment. If you react to a barking, lurching, digging, mounting, or grazing puppy with the wrong kind of intervention, you’re guaranteed a repeat perfor- mance. If instead you counter-condition, desensitize, or redirect them (more on those terms in a bit), you can guide your puppy to a behavior that’s more chill or socially acceptable, like chewing on a bone, sitting still and watching you, or fetching. Are you wondering, “What can I do to redirect my puppy to a new skill or to alleviate my puppy’s stress completely?” Read on to figure out the answer.",

This section identifies the various types of aggression and gives some advice on how to hold it in check.\n\nThe following descriptions and suggestions don’t take the place of professional attention if your puppy is showing aggression. Aggression becomes more serious as puppies mature and lose their puppyhood inhibitions.\n\nNever approach an aggressive dog, and do not face them straight on — those movements are perceived as challenging. If you get into an encounter with an aggressive dog, don’t run away in a frantic panic: Many dogs view this behavior as prey-like and may chase and bite you. When possible, drop your head and close your eyes — and don’t move. After a dog sniffs you over and accepts your non- threatening posture, they’ll likely retreat. If you need to move away, back away slowly and do not make eye contact with the dog.\n\nDo you have an interactive pup under your roof who steals clothing for fun, barks for attention, leans against you in new environments or around strangers, or\n\nsuccessfully solicits attention whenever the mood strikes? Giving constant attention and dedication to their motion conveys the notion that you’re the one being trained! When you do finally assert yourself, a dog who is prone to use aggression to resolve conflicts may use it when you change gears and try suddenly to control them. To regain control, follow these tips, for starters:",

Although I reference a food dish, you should also practice this exercise with a favorite toy or bone:\n\n1. Condition your puppy to a positive sound, such as a shaking treat cup or a clicker.\n\nAlways follow the sound with a food reward. (Chapter 5 describes using these training aids.)\n\nPractice this step three times a day. Continue until your puppy connects the sound with a reward, and then go on to the next step.\n\n2. Once a day, while your puppy is eating a meal or chewing on a bone, approach them with the treat cup and reward them, at first, by tossing a treat at their feet and saying “Find it.” Do not reach down or take the food or object away.\n\n3. Next, approach your puppy and kneel or crouch so that you are able to toss the treat into their bowl while they are eating or between their paws. If your puppy tenses up or growl as you approach them during a meal, stop and seek professional advice immediately. Your puppy is too close to what’s known as a biting threshold and may bite anyone who stands too close them. Don’t let your puppy become another dog-bite statistic.\n\n4. When your pup is comfortable with your kneeling and tossing a treat into their bowl or by their feet, try letting them take the reward from your hand.",

Proceed only to the point that your puppy seems happy and comfortable with your interactions.

Because they do, they consider themselves victorious, which reinforces their territorial aggression.\n\n» Dogs are isolated during greetings or visits: These isolated dogs may develop what I call frustrated territorial aggression (FTA), which isn’t a good thing.

If your puppy is relaxed enough to take a treat, ask the visitor to cast a handful of treats on the floor and play Find It.\n\n» If your puppy barks or acts hyper, stay calm. Shouting or other demonstra- tive corrections add more negative energy to an already tense situation. Stay calm and use a leash to direct your puppy “Back” and behind you. Focus your puppy on a bone or toy until they’ve calmed down, and then introduce them when the situation is appropriate.\n\nIf your situation is already out of hand, purchase a head collar (described in Chapter 5) and leash or station your puppy during arrivals. This collar reduces the negative restraint around the neck and places the puppy’s body in a submissive posture.\n\nHandling an aggressive dog on a chain collar is like holding an angry man’s arms behind their back. It creates fury. Using a head collar or front-clip harness (what is collectively called compassion wear) reduces this tension and communicates structure and discipline passively.",

So, if your puppy is threatening anyone, get help immediately. A territorial puppy, no matter the breed, almost always turns into a dangerous dog.\n\nDoes your puppy feel threatened when unfamiliar dogs or people approach? Even outside their territory, do they react aggressively when anyone approaches? If so, they may think it’s their job to defend themselves against the unknown. You must teach them to look to you when their life feels overwhelming.\n\nMany dogs develop a protective relationship when their owners are too relaxed during a walk, as in talking on their cellphone and paying little attention to where they’re going and who they’re with — namely, their puppy. If you want a well-mannered puppy, take an active role in the walk to ensure that they walk respectfully at your side. Otherwise, your dog will roam in front or drag you along and then act aggressively when they encounter unknown situations, people, or other animals.\n\nTo correct protective aggression, you must identify what your puppy’s triggers are (seeing or hearing people at the front door, through the window, or on the street, for example,) and then train and work with your puppy to keep them below their breaking point. Meanwhile, find a treat or toy and reward them until they make a more positive association to the trigger. Here are some other tips you may find helpful:\n\nThese teaching tools control your puppy passively with very little pressure.

Is your puppy giving you no respect?\n\nPredatory aggression is an instinctive behavior from pre-domestication, when dogs still had to hunt for survival. Most dogs still possess a chasing instinct. Even though breeders have suppressed the drive to kill in most breeds, some dogs instinctively chase and, in some instances, catch what they’re after.\n\nIf you have a chaser on your hands, rehabilitating them is quite a project. Instincts hold powerful sway over behavior. Focused play gives a chaser an outlet, but you\n\nneed to redirect their impulses with other animals or children to discourage inter- active chasing rituals. For focused predatory games, see Chapter 20; to correct your puppy’s impulses with kids, see the discussion of chasing behavior in Chapter 15.\n\nEvery litter has its shy puppies. These mama’s boys or girls depend on their mom’s wisdom for safety. After these pups move into human homes, they con- tinue to be needy. Their timidity, which surfaces in new situations, may turn into overwhelming fear if you don’t give them proper direction and support. A puppy in this situation may react aggressively during adolescence.\n\nAlthough shyness is a temperamental trait, a puppy’s reactivity can be toned down through routine socialization and exposure to specific stimulations. Dis- cover what motivates this puppy — food, toys, or loving attention — and use it to help your puppy react in a more positive fashion to distressing situations.",

To help prevent this problem, you must begin training to teach your puppy to look to you for directions on how to manage unpredictable situations, like someone coming over or meeting a dog on a walk. You must get in the habit of looking at life from your puppy’s perspective and ensure that you remember to give your puppy directions when they’re feeling unsure of themselves or a situation.\n\nCalming your highly sensitive and fearfully reactive puppy can be unnerving for everyone—most of all your puppy! Stay calm and use familiar words and routines. Here is a list of suggestions:\n\n» Encourage everyone to ignore your puppy until the puppy approaches them. Ask people meeting your dog for the first time to shake a treat cup, click and treat, or extend a tasteful snack.\n\nWhen people back away from a threatening puppy, the puppy receives the message that aggression works.\n\n» Remember the phrase hip-to-head when introducing your puppy.

Such a reaction only adds to the tension.\n\nOverlapping-territory disputes usually result from a lack of early socialization or from having a neighbor dog who is tense and reactive.

Idiopathic aggression falls into two general categories:\n\n» Erratic viciousness: At unpredictable intervals, a puppy in this category\n\ngrowls fiercely from their belly. This behavior may happen when the puppy’s owner passes the food bowl, approaches when they’re chewing a toy, or even walks past them.

These breeds have a greater propensity toward reactive responses like aggression when they feel threatened, because they’re not genetically programmed to look to people for interpretation. Breeds from the Herding and Sporting groups are genetically programmed to look to people for direction, so seeing a 17-week-old Golden Retriever, known for its passive nature, growling over their dish is more alarming than seeing a protective dog growl over their possessions. Neither dog should growl, but a growling Golden indicates that you may have a deeper problem than just a breed-inherent trait. Research the breed. Recognize your pup’s personality. Understanding their natural inclinations and working through them at the earliest age possible can help you prevent problems.\n\nAge: A very young puppy should not show serious signs of protecting food and toys. Though an occasional play growl is normal, hard stares and belly growls are causes for concern; consult with a professional to determine how you ought to han- dle your situation. As your puppy matures, their hormones will release, and they may begin to use more assertive reactions (like jumping up, growling, or nipping) to communicate.

    "page_content": "Temperament: Aggression is an emotional reaction when an animal is frustrated or fearful. All puppies determine early whether you’re giving direction or taking it. If you’re not considered authoritative, your puppy will take charge of their own life. As they grow, they become more mindful of sounds and stimulation and may often use defensive displays like barking or aggression to keep their space (your house- hold) under tight surveillance. Of course, passive puppies can show a similar type of aggression. When a passive puppy is neglected or untrained, they may assume self- protective behavior in reaction to changes.\n\nEarly play patterns: If you bring up your puppy on games of rough wrestling and tug-of-war, they may become aggressive during adolescence. These challenge games can set the stage for larger confrontations, especially if the puppy’s training is ignored.\n\nCorrective techniques: If a young puppy is subjected to heavy-handed corrections early in their life, they learn self-control through fear, not through understanding. For example, if you slap your puppy for grabbing a sock, they may grab the sock less often when they’re with you, but they’ll be more protective of the sock after it’s obtained (known as possession aggression).\n\nIf you have a puppy who shows aggression when resting, keep them off your bed or couch. You may not think it’s a big deal, but an aggressive dog thinks that these high sleeping grounds are their right to be defended, not a privilege. If you can’t keep them off your bed, crate or station them nearby. (See Chapter 11 for stationing tips.) If they growl as you attempt to relocate them, call a pro.",

Start these tips early on to prevent a lifelong barking habit, and remember that puppies sound off for a lot of reasons — primarily because they’re excited or stimulated but also because they’re just plain bored.\n\nThe first step in teaching your puppy not to bark is to recognize the impossibility of that statement. Puppies bark like kids talk, and though some are quieter than others, that’s all relative. Here’s a more realistic goal:\n\n1. Condition your puppy to everyday sounds. 2. Socialize your puppy to the people and places that they’ll meet and see throughout their lifetime.\n\n3. Teach more appropriate self-soothing activities to help your puppy cope with slow days or times when they’ll be alone. 4. Teach your puppy to quiet down on cue.\n\nA chronic barker is a real headache. How you handle your puppy, especially as they’re initially testing their vocalizations, will dictate how much barking you’ll hear over the next decade-plus. Your reactions should depend on what’s prompt- ing them to bark in the first place, and the following sections address the different possibilities.",

Barking is their way of alerting you to something that’s approaching. This trait was a key part of the dog- human bond that’s not as necessary as it used to be. One way to help your puppy condition to everyday noises so that they’ll be less likely to alert to everything they see or hear is to condition and desensitize them using food and fun. For example, to prevent your puppy from barking every time someone comes to the door or walks by, have treats and toys at the ready and use them to distract your puppy. Soon your puppy will recognize the noise as part of their daily routine, whereas yelling at them for barking will reinforce that something scary was going down.\n\nMake recordings of everyday sounds like the doorbell, the garage door opening, the elevator, or footsteps in the hallway — whatever might or does alert your puppy. Play these recordings at low volume to desensitize your puppy to the sound while playing or feeding your puppy so that they’re accustomed to the noise and associate each with good things!\n\nThe cardinal sin when rehabilitating a barker is yelling. When you yell, your puppy thinks you’re barking too, which leads to — you guessed it — more barking. To solve your problem, stay cool and follow the advice in this section.",

    "page_content": "In Chapter 9, I talk about the importance of socializing your puppy and how to do it. Nothing could be more critical in helping your puppy feel safe in your home (which in turn leads to less alert-barking) than socializing them to everyday rou- tines and people. Use treats and happy talk when introducing your puppy to your daily cast of characters, from your neighbors and friends to delivery people of every persuasion (postal, pizza, and beyond!). Here is a hit list of other essential socialization scenarios:\n\n» Anyone or anything approaching your car: Condition your puppy to see people and other animals approach or pass the car while you’re driving and when you’re parked. Use treats or chews or busy toys, and have people — like gas and fast food attendants and children — toss treats into the car when they approach to speak with you.\n\n» Delivery people, dog walkers, and yard workers: These helpers are staples in our lives and come in all shapes and sizes. Ask them to pay the puppy toll each time they visit, tossing a super prize to your puppy each time they enter — a handful of high-value treats, a busy toy stuffed with a super-savory treat, or a tasty chew set aside for special occasions.\n\n» Plumbers, carpenters, construction workers, and so on: Whether you\n\ninvite working folks in to fix up your home (which I recommend you do if at all possible, just to socialize your puppy) or visit with some in the neighborhood, socialize your puppy to the whirring and the banging and the other (some- times random yet familiar) noises of manual labor.",

Get your puppy used to everyone by holding a puppy party as soon as you’re able. Ask whether you can bring your puppy over to watch the children play. Knowing that your puppy won’t be alert-barking every time they hear a ball bounce or see a bike go by should be encouragement enough to get started early!\n\n» Neighborhood dogs and cats: Introduce your puppy to neighborhood dogs and cats as early as you’re able to. Because they’ll spend their entire lives separated in a zoo-like existence, it’s far better that they exchange friendly barks, greetings, and get-togethers for occasional romps than it is for them to establish a defensive relationship.\n\nPuppies bark when they’re bored and have nothing else going on. They bark to get a rise out of you or to communicate with another pet or the barking dog down the\n\nhall or across the street. Your immediate goal, whether it’s preventing barking or redirecting an already formed habit, is to find another way for your puppy to self- soothe. One tried-and-tested method is to provide your puppy with busy toys and feeding tubes — hollowed-out bones or plastic, chewable container toys — that your puppy will have to chew and work on to get their food. I realize that might sound cruel to you, but dogs are programmed to hunt, and after a few days of working fervently to get their food from a chewable feeding tube, the activity will be a more pleasant and exhausting habit than barking their head off — so much so that habitual chewing will take the place of chronic barking!",

When you yell, you’re reinforcing the barking and supporting your puppy’s role as border patrol. Anytime you see or hear your puppy start to perk up, call them back to you using a treat cup or a dragging leash (refer to Chapter 5) if they won’t focus. Say “Shhh” and ensure quiet as instructed in the previous section before rewarding them.\n\nDon’t’ buy battery-operated barking collars. Aside from being outlawed for cru- elty in many countries, they’re virtually ineffective. Even the products that claim to be cruelty-free often misfire; all types leave your dog, at best, confused or scared, and, at worst, savvy to when it’s on, when it’s off, and when the battery has gone kaput.\n\nMost puppies test their barking prowess around four to six months of age, in the form of bratty barking. They bark when you’re focused on something else: the dishes, computer, or dinner table, for example. Prepare yourself: The first bark is always the most precious, but believe me: The barking-for-attention gag loses its glow fast.

Keep to the schedule laid out in Chapter 6, making sure you’ve given your puppy not only a tiring play romp but a midday nap too. A tired puppy is a yappy puppy.\n\n» Focus on good behavior. Reconnect warmly to your puppy whenever they’re chewing a toy, exploring calmly, or resting on their bed. Give them a sense of how to get your attention positively.\n\n» Ignore the barking if you can, and never yell. Your puppy translates\n\nshouting as — you guessed it — more barking. Earplugs help.\n\n» Interfere without attention. If you must address the barkfest, do so discreetly by entering the zone without eye contact or notice. Generally speaking, being in the same space will calm any fussing, but regardless, wait until your puppy has settled to leash them up for a walkabout, or place them in their crate or a quiet room with a bone to redirect their angst.\n\nPuppies mount for a whole host of reasons, and none of them is wrong or bad. Mounting, which is gender neutral, generally starts around five to seven months of age. Puppies mount because it feels good, new, and different — it’s a fun way for them to self-soothe. And yes, boys will mount things as a general response to their surging sex hormones, but this is only one of many situations that cause this behavior. Female dogs mount, too: In this respect, mounting is used to displace tension or test rank. So, don’t go off the deep end if your puppy — male or female — is scaling your pillows, your leg, or your neighbor’s Chihuahua.",

Pair your blocking with redirection and positive reinforcement lessons, using treats, toys, and attention.\n\n» Noting the triggers: Try to take note of the events that trigger the mounting, and begin a training regimen so that you’re able to direct your puppy at these times. Puppies are a lot like kids: They need the structure of socialization and lessons to instill civility.\n\nIf your puppy reacts aggressively at any point during these steps, terminate the corrections and seek professional help.

Here’s how:\n\n1. Pick one area where your puppy can dig to their heart’s content, whether that spot is around your house or in a park (if you live in an apartment or a condo). You can also buy your pup a sandbox to give their digging some satisfaction. 2. Bring toys and treats to hide when you model how to dig by digging yourself in front of your puppy. Don’t forget the garden gloves!\n\n3. Go to your puppy’s digging area with them every day, instructing “Go dig!” 4. Have a dig-fest. Dig with your puppy and cheer them on. 5. If you catch your puppy digging somewhere they shouldn’t be, call out to them and redirect them to their spot with the cue words “Go dig!”\n\nSpraying your puppy with a hose or setting mousetraps is cruel, and I don’t encourage those correction techniques.

What’s a puppy parent to do?! In this sec- tion, I tell you how to overcome leash resistance.\n\nThe first and most important question is how old is your puppy? Young puppies (younger than four or five months old) don’t like to stray too far from their den — also known as your home. Positive outings should be short to begin with and should be shaped with food. You can use your puppy’s meal to motivate them to stay with you.\n\nTo start teaching your puppy to walk with you, follow these steps:\n\n1. Let your puppy drag their leash around inside the house or apartment to get them used to having it on.\n\n2. Teach them to follow your lead by shaking your treat cup or luring them with a treat or toy. Gradually extend the distance between each reinforcement. 3. Begin to lift the leash and use it to guide your puppy through familiar rooms in your home.\n\n4. If they resist you, simply kneel in front of them (still facing forward) and tap the ground with your finger while you shake the treat cup or clap your hands to urge them along.

Should this worry you? Well, yes, a little. Swallowing a nondigestible object, should it get stuck in their intestines, can be life-threatening, requiring surgery to remove (which is in itself a trauma). What can you do to prevent your puppy from swal- lowing anything within reach? Here are six helpful tips:\n\n» Don’t sweat the small stuff. If your puppy is grazing on grass, sticks, and pebbles, you need to be mindful, but don’t go bonkers. Any hyper reactions will only draw more attention to your puppy’s activity, making them more likely to graze again. Instead, teach them the puppy version of Leave It (see Chapter 11), and take toys and treats with you on your outings. If you toss, drag, or play with treats and toys on your walks, your puppy will be less likely to search for random mouthables.\n\n» To a puppy, any attention is good attention. If you focus on your puppy when they’re mouthing, running away from you, or eating an unacceptable item, your body language and actions are saying “prize envy!” Your puppy will likely grab more things or, worse, grab the forbidden items only when you’re not looking.",

When you go out together, direct your puppy to these activities and play together.\n\n» Teach Bring. Your puppy can learn fetching games early on; use multiple toys when they’re young so that you’re always seen as having the better toy.\n\n» Never chase or grab objects from your puppy. Puppies love a chase — they always feel in control, even if it ends up in your favor. Chasing a puppy may lead to gulping the evidence the moment they perceive your interest in taking their prize.\n\n» Keep the house clean. The surest way to prevent your puppy from grabbing non-digestible items is to keep them out of reach. That’s easier said than done, for sure, but way less costly than an operation.\n\nSome puppies love squeak toys; others gut them. If your puppy tears or ingests objects, eliminate those types of toys or bones from their toy box. Find toys that your puppy enjoys playing with and that are durable to stand up to their ideas of fun.\n\nPuppies hate separation. If they had their way, they’d follow you to the ends of the earth. But, alas, they can’t. Puppies suffering from FOBA (fear of being alone) have varying degrees of separation stress. Although few puppies start with full- blown separation anxiety, many unfortunately end up there. To ensure that your puppy learns to cope with isolation, learn the three levels of isolation issues, in growing severity, so that you can analyze your puppy’s reactions and deal with the symptoms before they get out of hand.",

These puppies may begin to cling to you when you’re home, nudge, lean in, or paw for reassur- ance, sometimes just seconds after you’ve stopped petting them. Many prefer accompaniment when going outside or into another room. What you may think is bonding can quickly evolve into a more serious attachment disorder if confidence- building measures are not taken. (See the later section “Helping a puppy with isolation issues.”).\n\nIf your puppy is stressing when left in a crate, especially in the first days of sepa- rating from their litter, consider a Snuggle Puppy toy, as described in Chapter 5, to give them a sense of comfort when you can’t be near them.\n\nOne level above anxiety is distress, defined as a growing sense of anxiety when left alone, including hyper-excitement when you’re preparing to go as well as when you come back. You may notice a change in your reaction to your puppy’s behavior as well — from adoration to feeling guilty or resentful.\n\nPuppies who are distressed often eliminate or chew destructively when left alone. Never, and I say never — repeat, NEVER — discipline a puppy after the fact, espe- cially if you suspect distress. Your corrections will be paired with the separation, making each separation from you all the more stressful. At that pace, your puppy is at risk of going from a puppy who isn’t crazy about departures, but can never- theless cope, to one with full-blown separation anxiety.",

Because your comings and goings are a part of everyday life, focus on conditioning your puppy to be alone using the steps listed in the later section “Helping a puppy with isola- tion issues.”\n\nProperly defined, true separation anxiety reflects a full-blown panic state every time a dog or puppy is left alone — a state that’s soothed only when one of their loved ones is present. Symptoms include a pronounced reaction to anything that hints of departure — from simple readying routines like dressing, bathroom rou- tines, or even the sound of the car keys — to chewing, clawing, barking, pottying, stress pacing, window escaping, and frenzied greeting rituals when reunited. Although a discussion of true separation anxiety is well beyond the scope of this book, if you suspect that your puppy is far gone, reach out to the woman who has become the separation anxiety guru here in the states, Malena DeMartini. Her books, lectures, and personalized digital lessons are spot-on: Check her out in print and online at https://malenademartini.com.\n\nPuppies with separation anxiety cannot be easily isolated when you can’t be home. These dogs grow increasingly frantic in the crate, pacing, whining, and attempt- ing to escape to the point of doing physical harm to the paws or mouth or entire body.\n\nYour veterinarian may recommend a veterinarian behaviorist to help you analyze your puppy’s condition and prescribe medication to alleviate their separation anxiety.

Generally, though not always, puppies who show separation stress fall into one of two personality types (see the following list) and consistently repeat behaviors when left alone, whereas hyper or frustrated puppies cycle through good days and bad, depending on their age and their daily sleep-and-exercise routines:\n\n» Passive puppy: This puppy is sweet but undirected and needy. No matter the amount of affection you offer, it never seems to be enough. What they need in order to feel more secure in their world is more direction, not more attention, but because they’re not getting it, they impulsively check in with you, time and time again.\n\nTheir constant interaction speaks volumes: Their constant vigil to get attention is a sign of their insecurity: “Do you love me? It’s been seven seconds; do you still love me?” Although your puppy adores you, what they need most is the direction to help them organize their behavior in your home. Without guidance, this type of puppy is prone to a virtual panic attack when left alone in the house. » Assertive puppy: Left to their own devices, confident and bossy puppies like to organize the household activity, so they need to learn their manners and be trained to listen to their people. Headstrong, they’re often unimpressed by you — until, that is, you leave the den (your home) and they’re trapped inside. When that happens, frustration anxiety sets in.",

If you need help with training, get it. In the meantime, here are some tips:\n\n» Don’t waste your energy on correcting your puppy after the fact. You’ll only make your problems much worse. Your corrections get linked to your arrival, adding another reason for your puppy to stress while you’re out. » Think of it this way: When you leave your home, you’re trapping your puppy inside. They can’t get out if they want to — and they will want to. Puppies (like people) want to explore sights and sounds. Your puppy cannot snack, hop online, or text a friend either, so the best choice is to teach your\n\npuppy to rest or chew while you’re out. Left to their own devices and given more freedom than they can manage, they will get nasty and frustrated, which leads to barking, chewing (items as well as themselves), and marking.\n\n» Up the play and training routines to build your puppy’s confidence. Play and training go together — use words including Sit, Down, Place, Find It, Come, and Stay before you toss your puppy’s toys and offer food or treats. Work on tethering stays around the house. Take your puppy out for random adventures and play-train your puppy while you spend time together. These word directions and reassurances will help steady their nerves when you’re gone.

Make a list of possibilities, like Get Your Toy, Sit and Stay for ten seconds, or Find It games. Although giving your puppy attention whenever and however they ask for it might seem natural to you, just ask yourself what your puppy will do when you’re not there to satisfy their attention itch the second they have it?\n\n» Create steady come-and-go patterns. Leave your puppy alone a lot, even if it’s just to go to the bathroom or answer the door. Sure, your puppy will fuss — most do — but don’t pay a lot of attention to it. If they follow you to the bathroom or gate, say “Stay” and block their following with your leg. If your puppy whines or barks while you’re gone, that’s their issue; ignore them until they’ve calmed down. That means no eye contact, petting, or nurturing until they’re self-soothing or coping. Gradually and mindfully increase your departure lengths from 30 seconds to a minute to two minutes and then to five minutes to ten minutes. (For more on practicing departures, see the Stay exercises in Chapter 13.)\n\n» Establish a leave-alone routine. Keep in mind that dogs are by their nature calm, restful animals. Crepuscular (versus diurnal or nocturnal) means that they rest 75 percent of the day and are most awake at dawn and dusk. To create sleeping patterns in keeping with their natural rhythm and to reduce the separating stress they feel, follow a few calming routines:\n\nDrown the silence. Puppies don’t like silence: It often makes them antsy and unnerved as they’re left to interpret every noise they hear. Leave on reggae or soft rock, or buy specially composed dog music to mask the sounds of silence.",

Ideally, leave your puppy in a darkened room, like a mudroom, kitchen or bedroom, pulling the blinds and playing gentling music to drown out noise and encourage your puppy to rest while you’re out. Crates or small pens are good for puppies who’ll also be working on strengthening their bladder muscles.\n\nCondition your puppy to rest while you’re home. Use the sleep schedule outlined in Chapter 7 to establish resting and feeding times, and use your puppy’s crate for both, especially if your puppy is reluctant to settle during those times.\n\nLeave your puppy a favorite chew toy. Rub the toy between your palms so that it smells like you.\n\nIf you routinely go out for long stretches, either come home every three hours or hire someone to take your puppy out. Though it’s okay to leave your puppy for two separate 3-hour blocks of time in a row, any more may result in crate accidents or, worse, your puppy may develop isolation anxiety. If long departures are the norm, consider a pen, an enclosed room, or daycare. (See Chapter 8 for more on daycare.)\n\nDon’t give in to “pet me” solicitations. The petting-on-demand ritual makes being alone even more difficult. Going from lots of attention to no attention at all is too sharp a contrast for a pup. When they’re alone, your puppy longs for com- panionship. Because watching the soaps or chewing fingernails isn’t an option for them, they instead may devour your couch.",

Give them a stash of high-value treats, and encourage them to dole them out by tossing them on the floor and playing Find It.\n\n» As the interactions at the door and with select people become less stimulating, see if you can approach the puppy without an incident. Begin to engage the puppy at the moment while continuing to avoid eye contact or directly facing your puppy, which may feel more like a confronta- tion than comfort.\n\n» Does the tinkling happen when your puppy is overexcited or frustrated? See if you can calm down. If you’re too hyper, they get scared; if you’re too frustrated or angry, they also get nervous. It’s just the way some puppies are: They know when you’re out of control.\n\n» Disciplinary actions are ineffective and make matters much worse. Forgive your puppy now — they don’t understand why you’re mad.\n\nUse treat cups and favorite objects to engage your puppy when they’re nervous or excited. Ask a guest to shake treats from a cup and to kneel versus bending over to pet your puppy.\n\nWhether you soothe or admonish them, your attention reinforces the moment’s mood, whether that’s excitement or fear.

The wrong diet can increase your puppy’s susceptibility to disease, infection, and, possibly, nervous/aggressive disorders.\n\nYou have a myriad of choices about what to feed your pup: store-bought or home- made, premium brand or run-of-the-mill, wet or dry. When nearly every brand on the market claims to be the best, how do you decide? Don’t worry. I’ve done some investigative reporting to get the scoop on just what makes one puppy food different from the rest. Here I explain the ingredients in plain English and then help you decide what the best diet options are for you and your puppy.\n\nAs your puppy ages, they’ll need a different balance of nutrition to keep them healthy. Like humans, older dogs need less protein and fewer calories.\n\nDeciding what to feed your puppy is a major to-do these days. Though all dog food manufacturers are sworn to meet your puppy’s nutritional needs, the amount of food you’ll need to give your puppy in order to meet their minimum daily require- ment ( or MDR) differs greatly: a fact that matters if you’re the one holding the poop bag. The ingredients they use, how they mix it, and even the tricks they use to make it palatable to your precious puppy are what set one diet apart from another. Some pet food companies take great care to use top-of-the-line ingredi- ents that most dogs can easily digest; other companies do not.",

Is their coat shiny and their nose slightly moist? Those are all good signs. Another significant sign is their weight and growth rate: It’s important not to overfeed your puppy, because it throws the nutrients in a well-balanced diet out of whack. Excessive weight or rapid growth spurts, which can be encouraged by overfeeding, can put pressure on their developing joints, bones, and muscles, causing skeletal pressure that may haunt their adulthood.\n\nOne way to judge your puppy’s weight is to feel their spine and rib cage: Though you should be able to feel the last three ribs, their shoulder blades, and their spine, neither element should be protruding.\n\nThere are key differences you need to know about before you can decide which food type is right for your puppy:\n\n» Dry food (kibble) is cheaper and more convenient, but it has more preserva- tives and is less appealing to dogs. Dry kibble requires processing to blend the various ingredients, and its cereal-like consistency is unlike anything a dog would be attracted to in the wild. Dry food uses lots of chemical preservatives to keep it fresh and prolong its shelf life.

But it’s more expensive, and it can grow bacteria and become contaminated relatively quickly, so you shouldn’t leave it out for more than an hour. For dogs with sensitive digestive systems or allergies, wet food can make a huge difference. Canned food also retains more water and uses less cereal-type grains than dry food, which can also dramatically affect your puppy’s processing because few dogs would nosh on rice or wheat stalks if allowed to scavenge for food. The soft, gushy consistency of wet food, as well as its pungent meaty odor, is often more attractive to both dogs and owners.\n\n» Raw food is another option to consider when choosing food for your puppy. A raw-food diet is exactly like what it sounds: a mixture of raw meat, uncooked bones (often pulverized), veggies, fruits, and a few other raw ingredients that strive to mirror the foods a dog/puppy would eat in the wild. Specialty pet stores sell premade raw-food diets, or you can research how to make well-formulated meals right in your kitchen. (Of course, safe storage and careful handling are musts when handling any raw food, so remember to wash those hands!)\n\n» Freeze-dried food is still considered raw food. Should you choose to rehy- drate it for your pup, it will have much the same allure as any other unpro- cessed diet. As the name suggests, the ingredients have been dried at a low temperature until all the moisture is removed, which eliminates the need for chemical preservatives.

With just a touch of water, it can be mashed into a nice gravy topping!\n\n» Home-cooked food is an increasingly popular option for feeding dogs of all ages and sizes. Home cooking, like commercial food, allows for a lot of variation, from the types of meats you choose to the extra additives that meet the requirements for vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates. If your puppy is prone to allergies or has a highly sensitive digestive system, you may want to consider this option seriously. You may end up spending as much or more at the veterinarian and on medication as you would on a high-end diet.\n\nIf you’re considering going this route, make sure you think it through carefully. While feeding your puppy a well-balanced and nutritious diet has many pros, it is a time commitment, especially if you have a special-needs puppy who requires more protein to support their development. Followed responsibly, the home diet can be modified for your puppy’s age, breed distinctions, and individual needs. If you need help with your homemade formula, check out The Holistic Guide for a Healthy Dog, by Wendy Volhard and Kerry Brown (Wiley). Your recipe may call for some tinkering until you get a formula that best suits your puppy’s everyday needs.\n\nWhen buying any dry or wet food, try to get human-grade ingredients (ingredi- ents safe for human consumption). Read the label before you buy. Low-end foods often use by-products, discarded meats, and additives to enhance the smell and color. Although the wet food may look okay for your plate, low-end foods can wreak havoc on a dog’s overall health.",

The only real similar- ity is in the percentage of components required to meet a dog’s daily allowance, which is determined by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Foods must contain six essential elements: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water. These elements make up the minimum daily requirement. But that’s where the similarities end.\n\nEven though the requirement is set by law, each company can choose whatever ingredients it wants to fill that requirement. For example, some foods include soy to meet the daily protein requirement, whereas other foods include meat or other animal protein. What’s the big difference between soy and meat? Your puppy will have to eat about four times as much soy to reach their MDR of protein than meat: which amounts to about four times as many calories and one ginormous pile of poop! For dogs, animal protein beats soy hands down.\n\nWhen searching for the right dog food, pay close attention to your dog’s digestion. Foods with low-quality ingredients aren’t absorbed as well and can give your dog loose stools. Good food should help your puppy produce two to four compact, inoffensive-smelling stools a day.\n\nThe following sections discuss each of the essential components in dog food and compare how the various grades of food meet these requirements.\n\nProteins (recommended 21 to 26 percent of the food)\n\nPuppies need protein for their growth and development and their immune system — more so when they’re in their growing phases. Your puppy’s food should be between 21 and 26 percent protein in makeup. (You can find out how much is in the food by looking at the label on the back of the packaging.)",

If your puppy leads a more sedentary existence or you’ve restricted exercise due to a recommendation or injury, speak to your veterinarian about reducing the ratio of protein in your puppy’s diet.\n\nMore protein isn’t always better.

Certain grains also may contain fertilizer residue, which can cause an allergic reaction. If your pup refuses to eat their food or if their digestion seems abnormal in any way, consult your veterinarian and bring along the labels from your puppy’s food to help the vet identify any possible aggravating ingredients.\n\nMake sure you provide your pup with a diet that contains more animal protein than vegetable protein by picking food that has two or more animal sources of protein listed in the first five ingredients.\n\nPuppies get energy and dietary fiber from carbohydrates.

Even though a dog doesn’t know the difference between lactose and lactose-free, their stomach sure does — lactose in dogs produces gas and loose stool.\n\nHere are some tidbits to keep in mind when researching fats in your puppy’s diet:\n\n» Many food companies have begun adding tallow fat to meet the minimum daily requirement. Used in the production of candles, this fat is inexpensive and indigestible. When a brand claims a “new formula,” make sure the change doesn’t include this unusable ingredient.\n\n» Supplementing fat in your puppy’s diet is often unnecessary. However, if your vet encourages you to increase fat content, use pressed safflower oil drizzled over their meal, approximately one teaspoon for small dogs and one table- spoon for large dogs. This oil has a high concentration of linoleic acid and is least likely to cause an allergic reaction.",

Note the ingredients to stay away from.\n\nTake a minute to read the ingredients listed in Figure 17-1. Compare the protein and carbohydrate sources, and then focus on fats — animal fat is a generic term for a class of inexpensive fats. Chicken fat and sunflower oil are better alterna- tives. Again, if you’re unsure, ask your vet for advice.\n\nSome people would say that the high-quality foods cost more, but that’s arguable. Consider that you have to feed your puppy more to get the daily requirements; when you factor in the health concerns, you may end up saving more money in the long term by feeding your puppy a healthier diet.

Gently mirror the brushing action with your index finger, removing your hand and rewarding them with tasty treats.\n\n» Make dental care part of a routine checkup! Veterinarians have recently discovered that your puppy’s lifelong health is dramatically affected by good dental hygiene; so much so that they’ve included dental checkups as part of your dog’s overall yearly health analysis. As your dog gets older, you may opt for professional cleaning. To clean your dog’s teeth, your veterinarian will need to scales each tooth separately and finish with polishing. Dogs generally need to be anesthetized for this procedure.\n\nSome puppies put up an enormous struggle when getting their teeth brushed. If your dog is averse to the brush, try using a plastic finger brush that loosely fits over your index finger instead, to ensure that you and your puppy get in the habit of cleaning their teeth regularly. If your dog growls at you, quit immediately and call a professional.\n\nLong nails can force your puppy’s foot out of position, causing strain, injury, or discomfort; if that weren’t bad enough, long nails can crack or break if they catch on something, resulting in sustained injury and multiple trips to their doctor.\n\nHow do you know when your puppy needs a clip? If you can hear their nails on the floorboards, it’s time for a trim. To keep your pup’s nails healthy, you need to schedule a nail trip to a local groomer or veterinarian hospital, or go the DIY route about once a month.",

    "page_content": "You can trim your puppy’s nails in two ways — with clippers or a file:\n\n» Clippers: You can choose from two types. The scissor type is considered best for larger dogs; the one that looks like a guillotine is best when clipping medium to small dogs. Many videos on YouTube are posted by manufactur- ers: Watch the videos and talk to your veterinarian before you consider the investment.\n\nTake extreme care to avoid cutting into your puppy’s quick (the tissue part of the nail). Aside from being excruciatingly painful, the cut will bleed for hours because the quick has lots of veins. To prevent excessive bleeding, purchase a clotting solution like styptic powder from your veterinarian. It works like magic.\n\n» File: A dog file is just sandpaper-like material on a stick or rotating tool (like a Dremel tool) that files your dog’s nails rather than cuts them. (Filing prevents that “cut to the quick” business mentioned in the previous bullet.)\n\nWhen clipping your puppy’s nail, clip the very tip, just at the point it starts to curl. (See Figure 17-2.) You may notice that your pup’s front nails grow faster than the hind ones due to the kind of surface they exercise on. If your dog has a dewclaw (a nail that rides high on the back or front paw), don’t forget to trim it.\n\nFIGURE 17-2: Clip the nail at the tip where the point starts to curl.\n\nWhether clipping or filing your dog’s nail, position yourself next to your dog, not front-facing (that position can appear confrontational and startling). Use treats and peanut butter to create a positive association with this activity.",

You should file off just the hook at the end of your dog’s nail, the same portion you’d cut with the clipper. File in 5-second intervals, praising and treating your dog between intervals.\n\nIf you’re reading this sidebar before you’ve had to cut your dog’s nails, consider your- self blessed because you can prevent problems before they begin. To avoid having a clipper-phobic dog, make paw handling part of every positive interaction, from petting to treating, by following these steps:\n\n1. Initially, just handle your puppy’s paws — nothing fancy.\n\nThroughout the day, touch and handle your puppy’s paws. Say “Good puppy!” then reward your puppy each time you’ve successfully held their paw for over 1 second. Have as much hand-on-paw contact as possible for a week or two. Perform no clipping at this step.\n\n2. Swipe some peanut butter (or a similar paste) across the refrigerator at your\n\ndog’s eye level. As they lick, rub their paws with the clipper.\n\nDon’t cut the nails just yet. Open and shut the clippers to acquaint them with the sound.\n\n3. Gradually manipulate your puppy’s paw to get them acquainted with having\n\ntheir paw held against their will for more than 3 seconds.\n\nTo do this, determine the best pose for you to clip your puppy’s nails. Will you have them stand with their paw on your knee, or do you want them sitting while you hold their paw gently in one hand and clip with the other. I tell my clients to face in the same direction as their puppy, rather than facing them as many puppies view that pose as threatening.",

Gradually increase the time, always rewarding them with a high value treat after they cooperate with the exercise.\n\nIf your puppy holds nicely still for up to 4 seconds but starts to squirm after 6 sec- onds, don’t reward the squirming. Dial it back to where your puppy was successful and reward that stage. Gradually — very gradually — inch back up to 6 seconds, even if you have to increase the hold one millisecond at a time!\n\n5. Once your puppy will sit still while you handle their paws for up to 10 seconds, try one cut — just one — by placing the edge of the clippers over the top of the nail and quickly squeezing the handle. Clear nails are easier to cut as you can literally see where the pink quick of the tip begins. If your puppy has dark nails, you need to take extra precaution. You can ask your veterinarian or groomer to give you a lesson.\n\nNote: Don’t correct your dog if they protest. Be understanding and slow down. Consider the alternative — filing instead of clipping. Again, nail clipping sounds like a major production, but in the long run, you’ll be glad you took the time to do it right. Anyone who has cut their dog or frightened them by being too rough can tell you that having a clipper-phobic dog is a nightmare.\n\nSoulful, sweet, comic — your puppy’s eyes express it all. Keeping them healthy, bright, and clear is up to you. If you notice that your puppy’s eyes are tearful, full of mucus, swollen, or itchy, see your veterinarian. Your puppy may be suffering from conjunctivitis (contagious to other dogs), a cold, an internal parasite, or an allergy.",

This lid protects your puppy’s eye from dust and other particles that are picked up near the ground. This third lid can become infected, so note its healthy color and take your puppy to the veterinarian if you notice it becoming inflamed.\n\nIf your veterinarian prescribes eye medication, administer it carefully by swip- ing something tasty on the refrigerator (peanut butter or broth) at a 30-degree angle above your dog’s eye level. Stand behind your dog or to their side and pull back the upper lid until you see the white of your dog’s eye; then carefully drop in the medication.\n\nDifferent dogs require different cleaning schedules, ranging from every couple of weeks to daily. As a general rule, floppy ears require more care than uprights because of limited air circulation. If you have a hairy-eared breed, you may be instructed to pluck the hair out of the way because excess hair can trap wax and make one big mess that cries out for parasites. Talk to your veterinarian or groomer for personal instructions. (Refer to Chapter 18 for information regarding ear mites.)\n\nFollow this general advice for caring for your puppy’s ears:\n\n» Clean the outer ear flap.

Signs of infection include a red or swollen ear, discharge, head shaking, ear itching, or bad odor. If you notice any of these symp- toms, get your puppy to their doctor immediately. Left untreated, infections can cause fever, depression, irritability, and loss of balance. Your veterinarian may prescribe an ointment that you administer at home. Here’s how to use it:\n\n1.

(See the nearby sidebar, “Taking your puppy’s tempera- ture.”) However, weather conditions also can lead to dryness or fluctuation in body temperature.

In such cases, use stainless steel bowls for your dog’s dishes, and clean with environmentally safe products.\n\nHere’s a fun activity your whole family will enjoy. Okay, maybe not. With all the techno- logical improvements of late, your puppy still has to endure the old thermometer-in- the-bottom style of preventive care. I recommend that you occupy their mouth with a tasty treat (peanut butter and treats top the list for my dog Whoopsie) while you dip a rectal thermometer in petroleum jelly and slide it in gently. The time varies by thermom- eter; read the instructions for use. Note that a resting dog’s temperature is between 100.5 degrees and 102.5 degrees, which is much warmer than the normal 98.6 degrees for humans. A good idea is to take your puppy’s temperature when they’re well so that you can gauge an illness when symptoms show.\n\nPuppies, like kids, need vaccinations and regular checkups. Get out your appoint- ment book and schedule regular visits to ensure that your puppy gets all the pro- tection they need.\n\nA puppy’s first vaccines should be given as they’re weaned off their mother’s milk. Unless a puppy is orphaned, which would require more medical interven- tion, that usually means a puppy’s first vaccine should begin at six weeks. If a series is recommended, follow-up shots are given two to three weeks later. These shots are called boosters. After the puppy reaches doghood, vaccines generally need to be given annually.",

Of course, it’s a little different from finding a doctor for yourself — you need to make sure your puppy feels safe and happy going there, too. Here are the most important factors to consider:\n\n» Knowledgeable doctors and staff: Those days when scruff-shaking, pinning, and staring down dogs to achieve dominance were regarded as acceptable behavior are long gone.

Any vet or vet staff member who tries to intimidate your pup with these forceful techniques or even a stare down should be avoided or educated. Although these practices still exist in some uneducated circles, they’re flat-out wrong.\n\nIf necessary, educate staff on how you expect your puppy to be treated, and if they’re less receptive, go elsewhere.\n\n» A less-than-terrified reaction: To ensure that your puppy enjoys their vet visits, find a facility that will let you make social calls, or, better yet, find a facility that offers puppy classes.\n\n» Clean, organized, and friendly: Make certain that the hospital you choose is well organized and clean.

Before you look up that word, let me cut to the chase. People are diur- nal: We’re awake two-thirds of the day. Some animals are nocturnal: They’re awake at night. Dogs are crepuscular: They’re most awake at dawn and dusk, and they sleep for 75 percent of a 24-hour cycle.

If you’ve been duped into thinking that your dog needs entertainment when you can’t be with them, you likely have a puppy who is chronically sleep deprived. And how will you know? They have trouble getting to sleep, they don’t like being left alone, and they’re very, very nippy. Flip to Chapter 6 for help — and get some sleep!\n\nWhen you bring a young puppy home, they have five needs: food, water, elimina- tion, sleep, and play — also known as exercise. Yes, exercise is a need! Your puppy needs exercise to keep their system in balance. Make sure you incorporate exercise in your puppy’s routine. Because a walk down the street can be frightening to a new puppy because of cars, big dogs, and other creatures, games (see Chapter 20) are the best way to tire them out.",

Though I do encourage social jaunts to town, I do not recommend that my clients walk their puppies far from home — for many reasons, including their fear-impression periods (as discussed in Chapter 9) and their immature dog-to-dog greeting skills (discussed in Chapter 12).\n\nExercise outdoors does lead to a calmer dog indoors, but proper exercise is the key phrase. Proper exercise involves planning age- and size-appropriate activities and setting aside time to join in the fun. See Table 17-1 for guidelines on deter- mining how much exercise and interaction your puppy needs.\n\nAmount of Exercise Suggested for Different Energy Levels\n\nIf your puppy doesn’t work off their energy outdoors, they’ll work it off indoors. Along the same lines, if you don’t run them, they may demolish your couch. No, it’s not spite. It’s just energy coupled with boredom.\n\nPuppies don’t like to exercise alone. They need a companion to frolic and play with. Unless you have a couple of dogs, you need to exercise your puppy two to three times a day for 10 to 20 minutes, depending on their age and breed. Although this amount may sound like a lot, after you get into a groove, the exercise will be fun and a good bonding time for you and your puppy.\n\nAlthough all puppy’s need to move about, their energy level is fairly set. My golden mix could run for hours, while my German Shepherd Dog-mix poops out after about 20 minutes play. Check out Table 17-1 to determine how much exercise and play your puppy really needs!",

If you leave your puppy out all day, you end up with a neurotic creature who digs in the yard and barks until the neighbors complain. Why? Puppies need time with you, inside or outside — basically, wherever you are!\n\nChapter 18 Identifying and Preventing Common Ailments\n\nThis chapter is a virtual encyclopedia of information about health problems\n\nand preventive care and vaccines. In this chapter, you’ll find a list of many of the common ailments and a list of the more serious conditions that your puppy may suffer from, including diarrhea, bloat, and teething. If you’re raising a purebred puppy or wondering about your mixed breed, a few discomforts are known to be hereditary, such as compacted anal glands and hip and elbow dyspla- sia. In life with dogs, as in life in general, it’s better to be prepared!\n\nIn addition, this chapter teaches you all you’d ever need to know about parasites, those that feast on your pup’s insides and on their skin. Oh, the joy! Thinking about any bug — flea, tick, or otherwise — nesting on or in my dog really gives me the creeps. External parasites live for blood — your dog’s, to be precise, although some settle for a human snack if the mood strikes them. I describe all these suckers (pun intended) one at a time, later in this chapter.\n\nFirst stop? Destination vaccination! A good rule of thumb: Prevention is truly worth a pound of cure.",

The good news? Many of these diseases are preventable with vaccinations. In this section, I detail the many vaccines that your veterinar- ian will recommend. Core vaccines are considered essential because the diseases they prevent are common and highly contagious — and have a mortality rate. Other vaccines may be a good idea too, depending on where you live and what your puppy is exposed to. Speak to your veterinarian about what they recommend.\n\nWhen your puppy gets vaccinated, your vet injects antigens, or small amounts of the disease itself, into your puppy’s vein or muscle. When the antigens are intro- duced, they act like a tiny army of invaders — two or three little disease soldiers. Instantly, your puppy’s internal defenders — the good soldiers — set out to destroy the invaders. The good soldiers win easily because so few antigens are present. Most puppies can conquer the invaders without developing any symp- toms. This internal battle of good-versus-evil helps your puppy develop a fleet of protectors called antibodies. These newly enlisted antibodies stand at the ready to shield your puppy if the disease reappears. The same holds true with human vaccines.\n\nCore vaccines prevent diseases that have a high mortality rate and are widespread in the United States. All puppies must get these vaccines or be at great risk of contracting and passing on deadly viruses. These inoculations are routinely given at 6, 12, and 16 weeks of age.",

The worry is that a puppy’s emerging immune system cannot tolerate or defend itself against multiple vaccines, so the puppy can get sick or even die when following a routine vaccination schedule. Though most puppies can and do tolerate the sug- gested formula, a few puppies cannot. These puppies get highly symptomatic, and — although it’s extremely rare — they may die from an intolerance of vac- cinations. If you’re concerned about your puppy’s sensitivity, speak to your veter- inarian about spacing out the vaccines instead of giving them all at once.\n\nThe highly contagious and often deadly viral disease parvovirus-2 affects the lin- ing of a puppy’s intestinal wall. Though puppies get a protective boost against this disease from their mother’s milk, your puppy will need three additional vaccina- tions as well. Symptoms include vomiting, increasingly severe diarrhea (yellow to\n\nyellow-gray and then tinged with blood), and overall depression. Although there’s no medical “cure,” early supportive care is essential to a puppy’s survival.

Distemper is tricky to diagnose because the symptoms appear in stages.

Stronger symptoms appear a week or more later, including eye and nose discharge, coughing, vomit- ing, diarrhea, walking and balance issues, and seizures.

Symptoms include fever, an enlarged liver, and coughing.

The disease enters the body, moves to the brain where it incu- bates for a month or two, and then causes disorientation, fever, personality changes (increased aggression and biting tendencies), and seizures.

If you see your dog scooting around dragging their bottom, it’s a fairly sure sign the glands are compacted.\n\nYou can either learn to express these glands yourself (ask your veterinarian to show you) or let the vet do it for you. Unexpressed glands may become infected and require a cycle of antibiotics and, in worst case scenarios, a surgical procedure.\n\nPuppies limp for lots of reasons. If it’s a passing thing, don’t worry yourself, but if it continues or worsens, here are some causes to consider:\n\n» Thorn, sliver, or obstruction: Your puppy’s pads are similar to a tire: thick and resilient but always pressed to the ground. Run your finger gently over your puppy’s pad to eliminate the possibility of an embedded foreign object.\n\n» Rough play or overexertion: Puppies grow throughout their first year:\n\nBones, muscles, and tissues are prone to aches and pains, especially if your puppy enjoys roughhousing and tearing circles around the yard or dining room table. If your puppy comes up lame, a few day’s rest and relaxation will usually improve their condition but if their condition worsens or doesn’t improve, it could be a sign of a more serious issue.",

They generally hang out in the lower portion of your puppy’s body, behind the shoulder blades. Contrary to popular belief, fleas don’t live on dogs — they only feed on them. Fleas live in carpets and grass, so treating the problem involves all-out war.\n\nTalk to your veterinarian about safe options for treating your puppy. Your vet may recommend collars, uniquely formulated pills, oil pouches, or other products during flea season. (Be sure to use these remedies only as frequently as the label instructs.) These products repel fleas, but remember that fleas don’t live on your dog so much as feast on them, so repelling fleas from your dog may result in their jumping on people. (The following section discusses removing fleas from your home and lawn.)\n\nDon’t spray, rub, or squeeze flea prevention products near your dog’s face or bottom regions, because most products are toxic.

Like fleas, ticks prefer furry creatures, but they settle for humans in a pinch. Unfortunately, ticks are found all over the world, and some can carry bloodborne diseases. Unlike fleas, however, ticks prefer to navigate to the front portions of your dog’s body, near their heart, and they prefer areas where the blood is located near the surface. (Think head and arteries.)\n\nTicks are remarkably tiny until they’ve filled up with blood — to find ticks on your pet, disguise your tick search as a massage session. Probing deep into your pup- py’s fur, feel for unusual, tiny bumps in your dog’s coat.\n\nTicks love to climb, so their favorite area is naturally around your puppy’s head. Removing a tick is no picnic. When ticks feed, they insert barbs into the skin like fish hooks. If you try to pull out a tick, you end up with a headless, blood-filled sac, and your puppy ends up with a nasty bump on the head.",

Here are the seven most common diseases:\n\nLyme disease (canine borreliosis): Lyme disease has spread to more than 47 states. It can affect most mammals (including you) and is transmitted through the common deer tick. (Nearly 50 percent of all adult deer ticks carry the disease.) After the disease gets into your dog’s system, it seeks out joints, causing painful inflammation, fever, loss of appetite, and lameness. Left untreated, your dog’s kidneys, heart, and neurological processes may be in danger.\n\nRocky Mountain spotted fever: Ticks carrying this disease are most common in the southeast United States, but they aren’t confined to that region. It causes failure of blood-clotting mechanisms, rash, fever, loose and bloody stools, bloody urine, nosebleeds, and respiratory difficulty.\n\nCanine anaplasmosis: This bacterial disease is found the world over and is recog- nized by its symptoms of fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, joint pain, and lameness. The bacteria is transmitted through the deer tick, western black-legged tick, and brown dog tick.",

It causes severe anemia.\n\nCanine hepatozoonosis: Ambylomma maculatum ticks (say that five times fast) carry hepatozoonosis and can go on to infect many major organs of the dog; however, infection is generally subclinical. (That’s doctor talk for a condition that isn’t severe enough to present observable symptoms.) Found in the South and Southeast, this disease is identifiable by fever, lack of appetite, weight loss, bloody diarrhea, as well as some bone and muscle issues.\n\nCanine bartonellosis: Like other tick-borne infections, this one is accompanied by fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, in addition to lameness, swelling of the lymph nodes, and inflammation of the nose and eyes (and heart muscles, but you can’t see that).\n\nYour veterinarian can run a titer test, which measures levels of antibodies or immunity to determine whether your dog has been infected with any of these diseases and needs treatment.\n\nTo remove a tick that’s already bitten down, follow these steps:\n\n1.

If you have children, keep the jar out of their reach.\n\nThe following tips can help you prevent ticks from feasting on your puppy:\n\n» Walk your puppy in the open sunshine. Walking in the sunshine is safer\n\nbecause most ticks prefer to hang out in shaded, woody areas.\n\n» Clean up your yard. Ticks lay their eggs, hundreds at a time, in damp, shady environments (like tall grass and leaves). They have several hosts and can pick up bacterial infections from any one of them. Charming.\n\n» Inspect yourself and your puppy during and after every walk in the woods or a field. If you’re with a human partner, take turns looking each other over from head to toe. If traveling alone, bring a mirror. Ticks can latch on at any level — they fall from trees, attach to the undergrowth, and crawl on the ground. How delightful!\n\n» Wear protective clothing. To protect yourself, wear light colors (making the ticks easier to spot), tuck your pant legs into your socks, and wear a cap. » Apply a homemade, nontoxic spray. Spray your puppy with a mixture of",

Round and irritating, this parasite feasts on the outermost layer of skin, on nails, and on hair follicles and is prevalent the world over. While most adult dogs develop a natural immunity to ringworm, it isn’t uncommon in young puppies. Though not fatal, it’s contagious through direct, skin-to-skin contact (dog-to-dog, dog-to-human, dog-to-whatever-living-thing) — and even through contact with objects or sur- faces that an infected person or animal has recently touched or rubbed against.

Before treating for these parasites, make sure you get a diagnosis from your vet to ensure that the treat- ment is parasite-specific. (Infections can cause some of the same symptoms.) Read on to find out what symptoms may indicate mites or mange.\n\nEar mites crawl into your puppy’s skin to reproduce. These eight-legged buggers nestle in your dog’s ear and feed on the outer layer of skin. The first sign of ear mites is your puppy’s behavior — they’ll scratch their ear intently, shake their head, and walk funny.\n\nYou can check for ear mites by examining your dog’s ear canal. If the canal is filled with brown wax and is crusty around the edge, take your pup to the vet. Your veterinarian can determine whether mites (or another sort of infection) are the problem and can quickly get your pup on the road to recovery. After your puppy\n\ngets a professional flushing from their doctor, you need to follow up with drops and cleaning procedures.\n\nMange mites are nasty little creatures that are related to ear mites. However, they’re more free-ranging than ear mites and often localize along the spine, legs, head, or underside of your puppy’s body. Here are the three different types of mange mites (talk to your vet for a diagnosis and treatment):\n\n» Cheyletiella, or walking dandruff: These critters hang out along your puppy’s spine and create a lot of flaking as they munch on their skin. The surest sign is intense scratching and nibble-biting along the spine.",

Their favorite spots are the head, legs, and underside. The surest sign is a puppy who literally can’t stop itching all over.\n\nAs much as you may want to control your pup’s itch with anti-inflammatories, don’t.

Make it a game and play just before feeding so that you can use their meals and high-value treats as motivation. Memorize the phrase “You look marvelous!” and say it to your puppy in a silly, happy tone each time they slip into their garment. Sure, it looks hideous to you, but wearing a muzzle at some point in their lives may be a necessary option., and a willing- ness to wear one may help them get the medical care they need. (Refer to my YouTube channel for visual tips!)\n\n» Gauze and hold: Pretend your puppy is bleeding. Just like with people, you need to apply continuous pressure on the wound. Practice holding gauze on an imaginary wound as you talk in a calming voice. Hold the pad on for three seconds, release, and then offer a treat. Continue to increase the holding time, and always reward your dog after you let go in order to reward their cooperation.\n\n» Pretend eye applications: When dogs feel uncomfortable, they squirm. To\n\nget yours used to having their face and eyes managed, have a friend lure your puppy with a treat or chew. Touch the dropper to your puppy’s cheek, at least 2” from their eye. Reward your dog after you pull the dropper away. Gradually increase the time and move closer to the eye itself, using a soft voice and touch, and provide tasty lures until your puppy is comfortable with the interaction.\n\n» Tweezers, flashlights, and plastic gloves, oh my! The same rules apply for these objects: Condition your puppy to the feel, smell, and sight of these strange objects before using them in an emergency.",

Though I hate to say it, because fences create a zoo-like vibe, having one is a necessary evil. When choosing a fence, however, you have a few options.\n\nIf you’re able to fence your yard, do it! Fenced enclosures allow your dog to have freedom versus constantly keeping them leashed or putting them on a tie-out. Both restrict your dog unnaturally and may cause injury or death if affixed to their tender neck. If possible, include your home, also known as your dog’s den, within the fenced area, versus placing the pen in a distant portion of the yard — all dogs prefer to be close to the den when resting or eating.\n\nYour puppy is a social creature and may not want to stay outside alone until they’re older and more confident. Be creative when decorating your dog’s play yard. Use jumps and tunnels, swinging objects, toys, bones, and puzzle feeders to direct your puppy’s attention when you play together.\n\n» Physical barriers: These above-ground fences are considered by most\n\n(including myself) to be the most humane because they don’t require that your dog wear a battery-operated collar that shocks your dog when they cross the flagged barrier.\n\nThe variety of physical fences includes picket, chain-link, and split rail.\n\nOne drawback to physical fences is that gates may be left ajar and your dog may wander. Be careful, especially when visitors come and go.",

Working with an electric fence company, you’ll determine the parameters and have the fence installed. After the wiring is in place, you’ll place flags in the ground to let the dog know the location of the fence border. You then take your dog to these flags with the electric collar to demonstrate how the shock works.\n\nSome dogs can habituate to the shock, even on the highest setting, so be mindful of selecting this as your fencing type if your dog is large and bold enough to burst through the shock.\n\nMany people attest that electrical collars are traumatizing and cruel. They are, however, a less expensive option and have caught on around the globe. Though I’m not one for strapping a pronged shocking-collar on my dogs, I respect any- one’s personal decision to do so.\n\nTraining your puppy to concentrate their attention\n\nWhen I hear about a puppy breaking away from their person and tragically getting hit by a car, I want to cry. I always think — could training have helped? After all, teaching your puppy the meaning of words like Come and Stay is so that you’re able to use them in a pinch to keep them safe around distractions. Off-leash con- trol can be easily shaped during your puppy’s late adolescence; flip to Chapter 13 for tips. Until that time, use long lines, dog parks, or enclosures to keep them safe.\n\nIf your puppy has an accident, stay cool. If you lose it, they’ll get nervous and go to pieces. Be a rock of confidence. Be mentally tough. Organize. Think. If neces- sary, get them to the hospital as quickly and efficiently as possible. If you’ve pre- pared with the following information, you’ll be fine.",

All first aid kits should have a muzzle: See the tips in the “Playing puppy doctor”\n\nsection, earlier in this chapter, about “muzzle on, muzzle off,” or watch my YouTube video on how to positively condition your puppy to wear a muzzle.\n\nIf you’re caught unprepared, though, you can get by using a belt, rope, or bandana to prevent biting. Here’s how it would work with a bandana:\n\n1. Fold a bandana into a long band. 2. Drape the center of the band across the top of your dog’s nose. 3. Cross the two ends underneath your dog’s chin. 4. Tie the ends securely behind your dog’s ears. 5. Check the crossing point underneath. If the crossing point is too loose, your dog may paw it off; if it’s too tight, you may choke them.\n\nTransporting a dog who has internal injuries is a tricky business. They’ll be rest- less and want to move. Your job is to make sure they don’t. If you suspect a broken bone, spinal injury, or internal bleeding, transport your puppy on a firm surface, such as a sled, an oversized plastic lid, or a piece of plywood. Otherwise, placing your puppy on a sheet or towel is acceptable. Don’t cover their face, or they may panic.\n\nBe ready for an emergency anytime by having a dog-size board in your home or garage.",

    "page_content": "Puppies can’t articulate pain. They can’t intellectualize it, meditate on it, or separate themselves from it. To them, it’s just pain — an intense feeling and a state of being. Pain puts dogs in a vulnerable state. It confuses their thought process and their physical organization. Their only drive is to protect themselves and alleviate their distress. Add that state of mind to your puppy’s natural tem- perament and what you get is a fairly unpredictable reaction. Though dogs experi- ence pain in the same way, they deal with it differently.\n\nChoking usually occurs when your puppy is chewing or playing with a toy and is suddenly challenged or startled or takes a deep breath. If you’re not around or you don’t react quickly, choking can be fatal. One way to prevent choking in the first place is to think smart: Don’t give your puppy toys that are smaller than the width of their muzzle, and remove any bones once they can fit inside your puppy’s mouth.\n\nIf your puppy chokes on something, stay calm and focused while following these steps:\n\n1. If you have a small dog, lay them on their side; if possible, bring your medium- or large-size dog to a standing position.\n\n2. Open their jaw to inspect their mouth carefully. If you can see an obstruction, remove it, unless a bone is jammed into their throat; let your veterinarian team know, because these kinds of objects require more careful removal.\n\nBe careful: You can jam the object farther in or get bitten if your dog is panicking.\n\n3. If you can’t dislodge the object, try a modified version of the Heimlich maneuver.",

A bump or scratch or a bit of swelling won’t alter the day too dramatically. How- ever, if a dog is allergic to the bite or sting, the reaction can be severe or even life-threatening. Symptoms of an allergy include facial swelling, hives, fever, joint pain, muscle ache, swelling, vomiting, and diarrhea. If your puppy has this reaction, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nA severely allergic dog goes into respiratory failure, which can be fatal within minutes.

If you notice that your puppy has shallow breath- ing, a rapid heart rate, and a high temperature, cool your puppy gradually with wet towels, a cool bath, or ice around their neck, head, and groin.

The problem is that not all items can pass through a puppy’s intestines. Some get stuck inside, initially causing vomiting, gagging, dry heaves, or coughing, which can go on for days. If that’s not cause enough for alarm, the puppy’s loss of appetite is. If the intestine is blocked and nothing is done to remove the obstruction, the intestine ruptures, which can be fatal.\n\nTreatment depends on how soon you get your puppy to the vet, because you often don’t know whether the object is sharp or could break (thereby rupturing the intestines), whether it’s small and likely to pass, or whether it’s large enough to block digestion. Unless your veterinarian can induce your puppy to vomit up the object (which they may or may not be willing to do to guard your dog’s safety), an X-ray is needed to identify what was swallowed.

Your puppy can learn patience and self-control through play, starting as young as eight weeks old.\n\nIn this chapter, you’ll find ten-plus games that are as fun to play as they are edu- cational.

Using directions like Wait, Sit, Down, and Come, you’ll play/train quick responses before your puppy has even lost their baby teeth.\n\nPuppies love to play Chase, but you’ll notice a theme in the games I describe in this chapter: Always encourage your puppy to chase you, not the other way around. Teaching your puppy to follow you and to drop an item they’re holding for the toy or treat you’re holding is an important habit to instill in a young puppy. Consider the opposite: a puppy who runs when you need them to come or who races off with a forbidden treasure, like your cellphone or one of the kids’ toys. Let me help you avoid that habit. Embedded in my description of the games in this chapter is the term “Can’t catch me,” which is a fun way to alert your puppy when you need to get their attention.\n\nThe Find It game is my dogs’ favorite activity. Anyone can play it (even strangers) to help your puppy’s mood, no matter what’s going on around them. Although I mention this game throughout the book, you can start teaching it anytime.",

Remem- ber this one rule however, especially when just starting out: Pocket and position treats strategically around your home so that each time you play “Tug” you can also teach your puppy to let go on cue.\n\nDirections: This game has two parts—the Tug and the Give. (See the next sec- tion.) Teach them the words independently of one another for 2 days, then pair them together!\n\nTo play: It’s easy to pair the word “Tug” with the action. Take any of your puppy’s fabric or rope toys, wiggle it until your puppy grabs hold, then say “Tug” as you apply resistance. That’s it. Over time, put a little more umpf into your Tug. Ini- tially, just use a second toy or high value food treat to encourage your puppy’s release. After two days of practicing the Tug and Give separately (as described below) pair them together as instructed.",

If your puppy has something you value in their mouths or an object that may endanger them, “Give” covers all bases. After you make “Give” less of a demand and more of a direction, your puppy will be eager to share their treasures.\n\nPlayers: “Give” can be taught to puppies early on, so puppies of all ages can play this game.\n\nTo play: When your puppy is chewing something, whether appropriate or not, approach them with a treat cup or a handheld treat. Hold the treat near their nose, saying “Give” the moment they release the object. If the object is their toy, how- ever, do not take it — let them keep it. If it’s something they (in your opinion) shouldn’t have, reward them with a jackpot of treats as you remove the object calmly.",

The extant training models focus largely on quadrants in learning theory yet sadly, have too often been misused as a rationale and justiﬁcation for the application of punitive methods in training. The ubiquitous misapplication of methods in an unregulated industry is the problem. Doing psychological or physical harm to a captive dog points to a lack of skill and competence on the part of the trainer. There is no justiﬁcation for harsh treatment or training with dogs, or any animal for that matter, unless one’s life or safety is in immediate danger.

We seek to “do no harm” physically or psychologically to dogs under our care and training at all times.\n\nShock collar training is a serious animal welfare concern in the United States and across the globe. Frequently, animal abuse masquerades as dog training.

The popular myth that shock “saves lives” has no evidence to support it. Indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. A hypothetical fallacy with the alternative of either shocking a dog or euthanizing a dog is a patently false dichotomy commonly posed by shock proponents. Dr. Overall states unequivocally, “The use of shock does not bring dogs back from the brink of euthanasia; instead, it may send them there” (p. 111). Using punitive methods or devices in training can cause an increase in anxiety that often leads to further behavioral problems, resulting in pet parents relinquishing their animals to overﬂowing shelters. If progressive zoos are successful in changing the behavior of the animals in their care using force- free training methods alone, behavioral consultants, trainers and other professionals, ought to do the same for our pet dogs.\n\nIn addition, dog bites are an increasingly grave public safety issue, making dog-training methods a public health concern. Bite incidents resulting from the administration of shock are not uncommon—it is well documented in scientiﬁc literature that inﬂicting pain is a cause of aggressive behavior.",

The Hierarchy of Dog Needs (HDN) is a wholistic system of care that takes a clear and ethical stand on dog welfare needs and dog-training methods and devices. The HDN is a novel adaptation of renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of (human) Needs that emphasizes strengths, positivity, free will/choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature (Maslow, 1943). Research shows that when biological needs, safety needs, and belongingness needs are met for social animals, they are far less likely to display abnormal behavior.

Anyone who interacts with or studies dogs, or any animal for that matter, can use it successfully. The HDN lists dog needs hierarchically but the levels are ﬂuid rather than static.

This Ethics Code is intended to provide speciﬁc standards to cover most situations encountered by psychologists. It has as its goals the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work and the education of members, students and the public regarding ethical standards of the discipline.\n\nGeneral Principles. Principle A: Beneﬁcence and Nonmaleﬁcence Psychologists strive to beneﬁt those with whom they work and take care to do no harm [emphasis added]. In their professional actions, psychologists seek to safeguard the welfare and rights of those with whom they interact professionally and other affected persons and the welfare of animal subjects of research.\n\nSection 2: Competence 2.03 Maintaining Competence Psychologists undertake ongoing efforts to develop and maintain their competence. 2.04 Bases for Scientiﬁc and Professional Judgments Psychologists’ work is based upon established scientiﬁc and professional knowledge of the discipline.

However, these two types of learning are typically spoken of independently so students and trainers may more easily understand the concepts of behaviorism. With this clarity, practitioners can identify the underlying principles leading to the formulation of a plan for treating a speciﬁc problem, behavior, or emotion. The researchers most notably responsible for developing these representational systems of behavior are research scientists Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner.",

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs—The Third Force in Behavior\n\nStudents of psychology are familiar with The Hierarchy of [human] Needs. The Hierarchy of Dog Needs is a novel variation of renowned psychologist, Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, adapting a human model of behavior to ﬁt dogs. Similar needs occur in all species.\n\nAnimal models of human needs are traditionally used in research where the results and conclusions are extrapolated to humans to help us understand disease and develop treatments in medicine and behavior. Pavlov developed his theories of classical conditioning using dogs as his subjects in research. Skinner developed his theories of operant conditioning using pigeons as his research subjects. The ﬁeld of comparative psychology explores cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals (Tinbergen, 1963).\n\nMaslow, disenchanted with the popularized behaviorist paradigm of his time, cofounded the school of thought in psychology called humanism, the Third Force that emerged subsequent to psychoanalysis and behaviorism the summer of 1938, Maslow conducted (Leahey, 2001). During anthropologic research on a Blackfoot Native American reservation that is believed to have inspired him to theorize a new understanding of the fundamental features of human nature (Taylor, 2019).",

    "page_content": "Humanistic psychology emphasizes strengths, positivism, choice, and a belief in the wholeness of animal nature. In Maslow’s own words: “Self- actualized people have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may have become to others” (Maslow, 1943, pp. 370–396). Does this not deﬁnitively describe what we often observe in our dogs? We witness our dogs taking great joy in simple things, over and over again. Taking a (w)holistic view of the sentient dog, The Hierarchy of Dog Needs combines both wholeness and behaviorist templates for wellness and emotional and behavioral modiﬁcation understanding that both mental events and previously reinforced learned behaviors are causal. Humanism asserts that the present and the future and the past inﬂuence us.\n\nFollowing on the heels of Maslow’s work and others, the former President of the American Psychological Association, and renowned research scientists, Martin Seligman, became the face of Positive Psychology (Seligman, 2020). He called for an alternative to psychology’s “relentless focus on the negative” and for research into growth, mastery and drive. Today, much research and many academic textbooks explore topics including well-being, the science of happiness, and peak performance. Seligman’s most famous work on learned helplessness (Seligman, 1972) demonstrated that dogs that had previously learned that escape from shock was impossible, would not even attempt to escape once escape was on option. His breakthrough research shows that mental events are causal, even in our dogs (Seligman cited in Schultz & Schultz, 2008).",

Dr. Karen Weigle (2019), clinical psychologist, afﬁliated with the University of New Hampshire spoke out on shock saying, “This has gone on for this long because this is a population who cannot adequately speak for themselves.” Who will speak for the dogs? If not us, who? If not now, when? Professional positions opposing the use of aversives in dog training are based on both a sophisticated academic grasp of the neurochemical and behavioral mechanisms at play, and a desire to promote animal welfare in a civilized world (Michaels, 2015d). The hallmarks of leadership in science highlight the detrimental effects that painful devices and practices have on our companion animals. The advent of the Pet Professional Guild (PPG) gives medical professionals, research scientists, and other pet professionals a clear option for afﬁliation with an international, science-oriented organization. PPG members subscribe to No Shock, No Pain, No Choke, No Fear, No Pain and No Physical Force in dog training. It is understood that science cannot take a stand—but scientists can.",

A survey using the extensive Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) database (Serpell, 2020), or a separately designed survey, exploring the co-relational relationship between shock training and bites would be of practical value to scientists, animal welfare advocates, trainers, and the public. A survey study based upon a collection of statistics from veterinarians on the injuries and deaths from choke and prong collars would inform and illustrate the true extent of the problem using these devices.\n\nScientiﬁc presentations have real world impact on audiences, and moreover, on our companion animals. Pet professionals from an array of dog-related ﬁelds often incorporate these scientiﬁc interpretations into their practices and hold them up as a gold standard. New evidence-based practices are the driving force in social commitment to animal welfare policy legislation and the subsequent enforcement of sanctions prohibiting intentional harm to dogs. Scientists who adopt a clear and ethical stand on\n\ndog handling and training can help drive social change and shape laws governing animal welfare legislation.

Unless you are feeding a wet or raw diet, drinking water is most likely your dog’s only source of hydration for metabolic processes. Water regulates temperature, carries nutrients and oxygen to all cells, lessens the burden on the kidneys and liver by ﬂushing out urine and feces and other toxins, aids in digestion, and dissolves minerals and other nutrients so they are accessible to the body. Water also lubricates joints, moistens tissues such as those in the mouth, eyes, and nose, helps prevent constipation, and protects the body’s organs and tissues (Mayo Clinic, 2020a).\n\nA National Resource Defense Council (2003) study cites an article, “What’s on Tap,” revealing that the tap water of scores of United States cities is compromised.

In Decoding Your Dog: “All Dogs Need a Job,” Dr. Mary Klinck, DVM, tells us that a dog’s need for exercise is dependent on life stage, breed, and personality; however, individuals within each breed can vary signiﬁcantly (Klinck, 2014).\n\nExercise needs are unique to each dog. Have an integrative force-free veterinarian complete a wellness check for your dog before beginning an exercise regimen. Too much, too little, or the wrong type of exercise and mental stimulation can lead to medical and behavior problems (Marcellin- Little et al., 2005). Sadly, there has been very little research about the optimal frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise for dogs. However, if your dog is overweight, monitor your dog carefully, slowly increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise because the heart rate in overweight dogs during exercise is higher (Kuruvillaa, 2003).\n\nProvide frequent and regular physical and mental exercise appropriate for your dog’s medical condition, age, and breed. Proper exercise not only keeps your dog ﬁt, but it also decreases stress. It is up to us humans to provide sufﬁcient exercise that is fun, while at the same time keeps our dogs safe.

Excessive frequency,\n\nintensity, or duration of exercise can have a negative impact causing injury or making an existing condition even worse. Be sure to provide rest breaks, and build endurance slowly, to avoid cardiovascular fatigue. Fatigue can result in injuries. Be on the lookout for limping, excessive panting, or a reluctance to exercise. Exercise should be joyful. Involving other dogs makes physical activity even more stimulating.\n\nGenerally speaking, exercise gear may be a topic of heated discussion but not in the force-free training community. Force-free dog trainers recommend a back or front-clip harness for walking and running in order to distribute the pressure across the dog’s chest and body, rather than around the neck and throat structures. If safe for you, your dog, and others, let your dog run naked just with a collar and identiﬁcation tags.\n\nThe beneﬁts gained from safely practiced aerobic and non-aerobic exercise are enriching for both you and your dog. Look for unique trails, parks, beach areas, and neighborhoods to explore. If you prefer to watch rather than run, arrange for a play date with another friendly dog, or visit a safe leash-free dog park if your dog is a well-mannered social butterﬂy. (See Chapter 9, Dog Parks and Dog Play.)\n\nFor the most part, just like humans, senior dogs continue their desire for activity and exercise, but at a slower pace. Arthritis may negatively impact your dog’s ability, comfort, and desire to exercise. Understanding both the physical and the behavioral factors involved in our aging dogs provides the best exercise guidance.",

Pay attention to your dog’s comfort limit with distance and other endurance factors on walks. A dog stroller or wagon will allow your dog to continue to be part of family activities. Walk for a short distance and then let your aging dog enjoy a ride in the stroller or wagon even if you have a multi-dog household, keeping everyone together if possible. “Sniffari” walks, mainly to sniff, are highly enjoyable for most aging dogs. Snifﬁng is the window to the world where they can experience novelty.\n\nFor dogs who have always loved riding in the car, keep riding! If your dog is too large for you to lift into the car, make a small investment in stairs\n\nor a ramp. These aides may be the most practical way of including your dog on these visually enriching and olfactory stimulating adventures.\n\nScent tracking and interactive toys can be a wonderful source of mental enrichment when physical activity is limited. Therapeutic supervised swimming using a life jacket, socializing with appropriate playmates on the same activity level, or even playing with a respectful puppy whose playstyle is monitored, may help keep your aging dog stimulated.\n\nFor more guidance about senior dog exercise, Dr. Karen Overall (2013, pp. 690–697) has a brilliant section, i.e., “Protocol for Understanding and Helping Geriatric Animals”, in her Manual of Clinical Behavioral Medicine.",

(See Chapter 16, Leash-walking.)\n\nIf your dog needs more exercise than you can provide or if you have limited space, when safe for your dog’s age, medical condition, and morphological structure, consider exercising with a lure/chase toy. Some physically challenged pet parents who are unable to exercise their dog outside of the home ﬁnd a lure-chase toy a convenient way to make sure their dog runs each day. This toy is also recommended for pet parents who do not have enough time to exercise their dog on any given day. The chase- lure toy is especially beneﬁcial for prey-driven, high-activity level dogs or powerful breeds that love and need to run. It works great for small breeds as well and is a lot of fun for the handler.\n\nThere are some important caveats regarding lure-chase toys.\n\nThe lure should be kept near the ground, not lifted into the air. Jumping and twisting of the spinal column may cause injury.\n\nOnce your dog catches the lure, always trade-up, by offering a high value treat tossed away from the lure, giving you a chance to retrieve it safely. Better yet, teach “Drop It.” Otherwise, dogs may resource guard the lure, as if it were a prey item they’ve just caught. Allow your dog to catch the lure on occasion or the lure-chase toy game causes undesirable frustration. Exercise should be fun!",

If you have a carpeted staircase in your home and a healthy dog, upstairs fetch is like having a stair-stepper exercise machine for your dog. Toss treats, one at a time up the stairs. Do not toss anything down the stairs as this could result in injuries to dogs tripping and falling down the stairs.\n\nDigging is another great natural exercise for your dog that does not require daily time or physical effort from pet parents. Get a sand box or designate a special spot in the yard reserved for a dog zone digging pit where you regularly bury goodies.\n\nA puppy’s ﬁrst breath is a critical sign of life outside of the womb. Air is a metabolic requirement for survival, and it is the need that must be met ﬁrst. Abraham Maslow’s original work, A Theory of Human Motivation (1943, The Basic Needs section, para. 16.) delineates the basic physiological needs to maintain the body’s homeostasis. One of the most basic of these needs is the need for oxygen. Oxygen travels through the lungs and is then transferred to red blood cells that carry the oxygen to all of the organs in the body that require oxygen to function.\n\nIf your dog is having breathing problems, see your veterinarian as soon as possible. Breathing difﬁculties can quickly become life threatening. Air is a deﬁciency need (Maslow, 1943) and if dogs are unable to satisfy their need for air, at a minimum they are uncomfortable and at the extreme, they are suffering and often medically endangered. The body cannot function properly with inadequate oxygen and will ultimately fail.",

If the force from a dog pulling on a ﬂat collar raises intraocular pressure [pressure inside the eyes], imagine how high that pressure must rise when you actually yank the dog with a thin chain! Even if your dog has no eye issues, the choke chain is notorious at exacerbating airway issues. For instance, it can worsen coughing in dogs prone to collapsing trachea (weak trachea that ﬂatten more than they should) and affect the ability of dogs with small tracheas, such as pugs and bulldogs, to breathe. (Yin, 2012a, Choke Chain section, para. 5).\n\nThis report from a senior veterinary clinician appears in the New York Post, “Pet owners might use choke or prong collars to help train a dog that pulls on the leash, but accidents with these devices can cause serious injury,\n\nincluding permanent neurological problems—or even death,” said Dr. David Bessler, senior emergency clinician at Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners in Manhattan. “The whole point of a choke collar is that it applies force 360 degrees,” he explains. If a dog surprises an owner and takes off running, the collar snaps the pet back, causing whiplash, or choking. Bessler recalls a fatal case where an owner stepped on a leash as the dog started to run: “It caused an upper-airway obstruction and that dog drowned in its own ﬂuid” (Bessler (n.d.) cited in Sala, (2014). Punitive training with a choke collar, such as strangulation by holding a dog off the ground by a choke collar (a not uncommon practice), can cause severe brain damage (Dickomeit et al., 2013).",

Veterinarians and kennel clubs must discuss the problem openly with colleagues and pet parents. Due to the serious medical and welfare implications and the increasing popularity of the brachycephalic breeds, efforts to separate fashion from health are needed. Risk factors should be used to guide breeding decisions. In a study on the impact of facial conformity on canine heath, Packer et al., (2015) warns, “As such, breeders and buyers should be aware of these risks when selecting a dog and breeding organizations should actively discourage exaggerations of this high-risk conformation in breed standards and the show ring.” A fundamental rethink in brachycephalic breeding is necessary to save the breeds.",

Breeds such as the Pug, English Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, French Bulldog, Boxer, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, Japanese Chin, Shar-Pei, Lhasa Apso, and short-nosed crossbreeds are at great risk of developing BOAS because the soft tissue is crammed within the skull (Burn et al., 2012) often resulting in chronic and debilitating respiratory dysfunction. Thicker necks and obesity are additional exacerbating factors in brachycephalic dogs (Burn et al., 2015).\n\nPet parents too often dismiss labored chronic breathing difﬁculties and respiratory noise as normal despite their dogs’ obvious difﬁculty breathing, overheating, gagging, and choking while on short walks. Dogs may physically collapse and die due to lack of oxygen. Although these pet dogs often show severe clinical signs of BOAS, many pet parents do not recognize that their dog has a breathing problem. Pet parents may believe that these breathing abnormalities are normal signs of aging. Too often these dogs have acute attacks or lose consciousness before a pet parent recognizes breathing is a problem and seek medical help. In a recent study (Liu et al., 2015), 60% of French Bulldog pet parents failed to recognize BOAS in their dogs. Indeed, research ﬁnds that 58% of surveyed pet parents of brachycephalic breeds may be suffering because pet parents believe that breathing difﬁculties, noisy and labored breathing, gagging and choking are “normal” for that breed (Burn et al., 2012b). Some pet parents describe the medical symptoms of respiratory dysfunction as “cute.”",

Laryngeal collapse may occur as a result of stenotic nares and tracheal narrowing and lead to death.

Harrison sheds light on the reality of\n\nthe suffering of many brachycephalic breeds. She reports, “Many ﬂat-faced dogs try to sleep sitting or even standing up because their airways block when they drop their heads. It means that some brachycephalic dogs are chronically sleep-deprived” (Harrison, 2016, para. 1).

Sleep is a critical requirement for optimal health and emotional well-being. Puppies and dogs need to get the quality sleep and the rest their bodies crave. Your dog’s species-speciﬁc need for sleep is both similar and different from what humans need. Although sufﬁcient sleep is not discussed frequently, veterinarians, breeders, pet parents, trainers, shelter workers and foster parents are responsible for seeing that the dogs in their care have adequate sleep opportunities. Sleep needs vary with age, health, lifestyle, and among individuals. Sleep strengthens the immune, skeletal, and muscular systems. Dogs suffer physically and psychologically and cannot thrive without sufﬁcient sleep.\n\nNewborn humans require on average twice as much sleep as adults. Similarly, puppies need lots of extra sleep to grow, heal wounds and store energy to develop and function properly. Many rescue dogs come from very stressful environments, sometimes unavoidably so, with little opportunity for true relaxation.

According to Bentivogliio & Grassi-Zucconi (1997, pp. 570–576), “Pioneering canine experimental studies going as far back as 1894 show that sleep is a vital function, and that the lack of sleep causes brain damage and eventually death.

The relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety is well documented in clinical research (Pires & Anderson, 2012). Anxiety is one of the most insidious emotional consequences of both dream sleep (REM) deprivation and deep-sleep deprivation. Generalized anxiety disorder and phobias are associated with sleep deprivation, so anxiety may also cause sleep deprivation.\n\nThere may be a genetically hard-wired reason for your dog’s rumbling about during the night.

Dogs often nap around the noon hour and have slower activity during the afternoon hours (Tobler & Sigg, 1985). Approximately 44% of your dog’s time is spent in alert wakefulness and 21% in the drowsy state. Adult dogs sleep approximately one-third to one-half of a 24-hour-cycle, with an average internal bedtime of 9 pm and rising time of 4 am, according to a classic dog sleep study (Lucas, et al., 1977). Dr. Alexandra Horowitz (2009) also suggests dogs may have a burst of energy in the evening because of their species-speciﬁc sleep-wake patterns.\n\nAs stated above, sleep-wake patterns are species-speciﬁc. Humans most commonly sleep for several hours in a single session whereas dogs do not. A 1993 study of sleep-wake activity in dogs showed that the typical pattern of sleeping and waking in dogs is very different than that in people, contrary to popular belief (Adams & Johnson, 1993).

Wolves have dens, humans have bedrooms, and so your dog ought to have some sanctuary as well. For daytime power naps, your dog may prefer an open-door crate in a corner of a bedroom or other room, a cloth covered open crate, or an orthopedic bed set apart from the line of trafﬁc in your home. Puppies require more sleep than adult dogs. Keeping puppies in the center of the living room, with human activity continually disturbing their sleep, fosters stress. When setting up containment areas for newborn puppies, responsible breeders should keep each puppy’s sleep needs in mind, balancing Biological Needs with Social Needs. Senior dogs often require more sanctuary space as a safety net apart from other animals in the home to protect their aging bodies and allow for additional sleep needs.\n\nPeople pay close attention to the type of spinal and back support our own mattresses provide and understand how important proper sleep support is for our own well-being, however, pet parents often make the mistake of choosing the cutest or cushiest beds for their dogs.

During REM sleep, your dog’s eyes may roll, they may whimper, shake, whine, growl, and even bark on occasion. They often appear to be chasing something with all four legs pumping the air! Fascinatingly, because a large portion of your dog’s brain is devoted to processing scent, your dog may be dreaming in the scent sensory mode as well! “Those who see smells must remember in smells, too: When we imagine dog’s dreaming and daydreaming, we should envisage dream images made of scents,” Dr. Horowitz reports in Inside of a Dog (2009, p. 88).\n\nPuppies spend a greater percentage of time in the dream state than adult dogs, very likely processing all of the new information they are absorbing each day. Dreaming may be a bridge between the brain and behavior, having useful functions similar to dream function for humans.",

    "page_content": "Dogs adopt many different sleeping positions, some by choice, some as a security measure—and some because the only bed provided is in the shape of a donut. Feral dogs and wolves curl up into a ball with their paws tucked under their body and tails wrapped over the face to conserve body heat and protect their limbs, face, throat, and vital organs. This is the least vulnerable and least restful position for sleeping, however this position allows for a quick leap to the feet for ﬁght or ﬂight. Some dogs sleep on their stomach, also allowing them to jump to their feet easily in the event of a threat or an interesting activity they would like to follow. We also see the “splotz” tummy position (rear legs outstretched) that is often more restful, but still ready to leap into action. Dogs that sleep outstretched on their side are genuinely able to relax and are most often feeling secure in their surroundings. Some dogs sleep belly-up with their legs in the air. Generally, this indicates a secure and conﬁdent dog because it is a vulnerable position that exposes vital organs and the throat.\n\nDogs deserve and need to have indoor shelter. Because the natural sleep- wake cycles of dogs differ sharply from sleep-wake cycles in humans, your dog needs a quiet, safe dog zone, and a truly comfortable bed to take refuge from a busy daytime household to truly thrive.\n\nIt is Dangerous for Dogs to be Left Outdoors Unsupervised",

Leaving a dog outdoors unattended may result in medical, emotional, behavioral, and sometimes even legal problems. Of course, there are great beneﬁts to being outdoors, such as fresh air, sunshine, plenty of snifﬁng opportunities, and the freedom to eliminate as needed. Consider the safety and feasibility of a doggy door to have the best of both worlds with indoor and supervised outdoor access.\n\nInclement weather, or normal weather for your city, can pose some serious medical risks such as hypothermia or hyperthermia resulting in your dog being unable to control their body’s temperature leading to life- threatening survival issues, suffering, and death. Heatstroke may result from something as unexpected as fence-ﬁghting with a visiting dog in the next yard, or from playing chase through the fence with your neighbor mowing the lawn. Sunburn is painful and can lead to skin cancer. Protect pink noses, bellies, inside of the ears and top of the head, with a non-toxic sunscreen on short-haired/thin-skinned dogs when your dog is outdoors.

The Humane Society of the United States tells us, “Dogs (especially small dogs) should not be left outside unattended, should never be chained and should always be kept on a leash in public areas” (2016, para. 11).\n\nThe failure to provide sufﬁcient outdoor supervision and indoor shelter may result in the following emotional and behavioral problems:\n\nIsolation and loneliness. Dogs are now rarely considered farm animals (even if they live on a farm) but more often they are thought of as members of our families. Responsible caretakers and pet parents must recognize that dogs have real social needs that only we have the power to help ﬁll—or to thwart. Stereotypies. Many dogs develop difﬁcult to treat idiopathic obsessive behaviors such as tail-chasing, ﬂy-snapping, and self- mutilation due to isolation, boredom, and frustration from being left alone outdoors. Anxiety. Frustration arising from the genetically-driven need or a desire to engage with passing dogs and humans can lead to fence- barrier stress and may devolve into aggression towards people in general and other dogs. Guarding. Natural guarding behaviors may intensify and create or exacerbate existing human and/or dog-dog aggression. Aggression. Teasing from neighborhood children and fence-ﬁghting with other dogs may lead to aggression towards children, adults, and other dogs. Lack of rest.

The vaccine is not a substitute for an emergency visit to your trusted integrative veterinarian. Make sure your vet carries antivenin. If you live in or visit areas where rattlesnakes roam, ensure your dog receives the snake venom vaccine which is generally effective for venomous rattlesnakes. Side effects are rare.

Hyperthermia, more commonly known as heatstroke, is an environmental or exertion caused life-threatening medical emergency in dogs. Dogs regulate\n\ntheir temperature and cool themselves by evaporation (panting) and conduction (transfer of heat to a cool surface). Panting creates a cooling effect through evaporation of saliva in the mouth, on the tongue and from the lining of the lungs. The primary cooling mechanism for dogs is panting with the mouth open (Coren, 2010).\n\nUnlike humans, sweating is not a signiﬁcant mechanism of cooling for a dog. Dogs have no other efﬁcient way of getting rid of body heat other than panting. Dogs do not have sweat glands, except in their feet. Your dog’s fur coat can easily make your dog susceptible to overheating. Fur is an insulator that keeps the heat (and cold) out, as long as your dog is not in a continuously hot environment. Once the body temperature rises, however, fur slows the cooling process because heat from the body cannot escape. Dogs not properly conditioned to exercise in the heat and humidity, and older dogs may suffer heatstroke very quickly.",

If necessary, use a basket muzzle properly sized to allow room for a full-mouthed pant.\n\nTemperatures at or above 105°F can cause brain damage. If the body becomes overwhelmed by a rise in temperature because of excessive heat and humidity, heatstroke occurs. According to the National Institute of\n\nHealth (2016), heat waves pose risks for susceptible individuals such as the very young, old, overweight, and the health challenged. The sweltering heat waves of summer and the long-term effects of sudden temperature changes shown in climate change models are predicted to become more frequent.\n\nAvoid exercising your dog in hot and humid conditions. Proper hydration is critical to dogs, particularly when exercising in warm conditions. Hydrate, hydrate, and hydrate. In hot weather, before, during and after exercise, use a garden hose or spray bottle frequently to dampen your dog’s fur with water to create an evaporative effect to help your dog stay cool. A child’s plastic swimming pool placed in the shade can also help your dog regulate internal temperature.",

Dogs at risk for hypothermia include puppies, seniors, those with low body fat, heart disease, kidney disease, and hypothyroidism.\n\nShort-haired, thin-skinned, and toy breed dogs may lose heat particularly fast.

If you notice your dog shivering on any occasion, barring a medical condition or fear, take action. However, be aware that shivering stops as hypothermia worsens. Lethargy often follows shivering and paleness (Miller, 2019). When your dog’s body temperature drops, the heart, nervous system, and other organs are unable to function properly. Hypothermia can lead to coma, heart, and respiratory failure and ultimately to death.\n\nThe standard of care for hypothermia is to use warmed blankets from the clothes dryer, or a warm (not hot) hair dryer plus a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel against your dog’s abdomen: an unwrapped water bottle may burn your dog’s skin.

Equipment should be comfortable for the dog; if the dog struggles more, the groomer should try a different restraint (Martiya, 2016).

Worldwide it is exceptional that veterinary specialists in behavior are faculty in veterinary medical schools and yet the biggest single killer of pet dogs (and cats) are behavior problems.” More dogs are relinquished by pet parents and euthanized by animal shelters for behavior problems than as a result of medical problems. Sadly, the average pet parent does not know that most veterinarians, being medical doctors, are not necessarily knowledgeable about dog behavior. This may become a serious problem if a pet parent seeks behavior advice from a veterinarian not academically schooled in behavior as they often provide opinions on behavior or recommend aversive trainers.

They write,\n\nIf a trainer is observed using aversive training methods or if a trainer discusses out-dated ideas such as “dominance”, “leader of the pack”, or “alpha” theories, then clients should be advised against hiring them . . . After the health evaluation the veterinarian can determine if they have the skills and desire to create a behavior treatment plan or if they prefer to partner with a behavior consultant or trainer (p. 2.)\n\nVeterinarian specialists in Europe are often involved in conducting research, however, veterinary behavior research is rare in the United States the overwhelming majority of veterinarians are solely clinical as practitioners. They may not have a thorough understanding or knowledge of current animal behavior research, familiarity with aggressive incidents or\n\nevidence-based understanding of how to address such issues. According to the interview with Overall (2011), “A lot of our veterinarians are not thinking as scientiﬁcally as they could be.”\n\nAnimals who experience stress during a veterinary visit may mask their symptoms. Promisingly, there are a growing number of veterinarians who have sought education and are now specialize in the ﬁeld of behavior. More than ever before, veterinary doctors, behavior consultants, trainers, and pet parents are working together to make visits to the veterinarian more joyful and less stressful for dogs.",

It was not until the 1980s that there was a surge of interest in veterinary dentistry. According to the American Veterinary Dental Society, more than 80% of dogs develop gum disease by three years of age (Verstraete, 2016). Oral health is as necessary for your dog as it is for you and your other family members. Oral health has a profound effect on your dog’s general health, so do not forget to clean and care for those beautiful pearly whites. If left untreated, dental disease is often very painful and can contribute to other oral cavity or systemic diseases (Bellows et al., 2019, 2005). Periodontal disease allows bacteria and toxins to enter the bloodstream with potentially harmful effects to internal organs. Diseases associated with periodontal disease in dogs include bronchitis, hepatitis, endocarditis,\n\nkidney disease, and pulmonary ﬁbrosis due to chronic, recurrent low-grade infections (DeBowes et al., 1996).\n\nThe American Veterinary Dental College (AVDC) provides a list of signs of oral and dental disease in dogs.

Disease-causing plaque mineralizes on teeth in two to three days and then cannot be removed by simple brushing. Regular professional dental cleaning is the most effective way to clean beneath the gum line to prevent periodontal disease and identify problems: anesthesia-free dental cleanings do not clean beneath the gum line.\n\nIntroduce daily or twice daily brushing slowly by rubbing your dog’s teeth and gums with soft gauze wrapped around a ﬁnger.

Psychological and emotional health is every bit as important as physical health. Physical and emotional wellness go hand-in-glove. The insight that dogs lead rich emotional lives can be traced back to Charles Darwin (1809–1882) who hypothesized in The Descent of Man (1871, p. 448) that all animals experience pleasure and pain, happiness, and sadness, and fear.\n\nEmotions evolved to help us communicate with each other and they inﬂuence cognition and behavior. Today scientists and researchers, such as Dr. Marc Bekoff and the late Dr. Jaak Panksepp (1943–2017) who coined the term Affective Neuroscience, and Dr. Karen Overall, editor of the Journal of Veterinary Behavior, provide evidence on dog emotions. In The Emotional Lives of Animals, Bekoff tells us, “It’s bad biology to argue against the existence of animal emotions” (2007, p. xviii).

However, multiple emotional and behavioral systems may be activated in any given scenario. That is, both positive and negative emotions may be triggered in response to the same event. Panksepp’s Emotional Systems Model is explored below.\n\nAppetitive Emotional System: Seek, Care, Play, and Lust\n\nThe Seek emotion is the most prevalent. It motivates, stimulates, and often drives dog behavior. Dogs seek what they need and want, and also seek to ﬁnd relief. Some of the more familiar neuromodulators that drive seeking behavior are dopamine, glutamate, and endogenous opioids.\n\nThe Care emotion drives nurturing and social bonding with humans and other animals. Two of the hormones involved in social bonding, including maternal bonding, are oxytocin, which acts as a neurotransmitter, and prolactin. Other neuromodulators that drive care include dopamine and the endogenous opioids.\n\nPlay drives the dog’s learning of social rules and deﬁnes social interactions through social bonding and having fun. It is expressed by affection, joy, and the satiation of needs. When needs are met, dogs seek to play. As a puppy, play helps dogs interact better when they reach adolescence and adulthood. Neuromodulators involved in play are glutamate, acetylcholine, endogenous cannabinoids and opioids.\n\nLust is driven by the need to mate and reproduce—to transfer one’s own genome. Hormones involved in driving lust include vasopressin, (which functions as a neurotransmitter), testosterone, and estrogen.",

Grief is inhibited by secure attachment involving the endogenous opioids, and oxytocin and prolactin, the main social bonding modulations. Grief is driven by deﬁcits in these neuro modulations and where achieving secure attachment may have been thwarted.\n\nFear is the emotion that drives the Fight/Flight Syndrome, along with other “F’s,” notably: Freeze, fawn, ﬁdget, and fornication under stressful situations. A real or perceived threat or a sudden loud noise, for example, drives fear. Fear itself is aversive but it sharpens the ability to escape and avoid potentially dangerous the neuromodulators, glutamate and epinephrine and norepinephrine which are both hormones and neurotransmitters.\n\nWhen seeking is interrupted, Rage may be aroused, which interacts with the fear systems. The rage core system invigorates aggression when a dog is frustrated or restrained, has its needs thwarted, or seeks to defend itself or its territory. Neuromodulators that arouse this system are Substance P and glutamate, while opioids and GABA inhibit the system.\n\nThe need for a sense of security and protection from danger is basic to all mammals and necessary to thrive. It is the pet parent’s job to teach their dogs that the world is a safe place, both physically and psychologically. Failure to meet security needs in environments and relationships leads to anxiety and psychological disorders that sometimes mirror those found in humans.

(See Chapter 8, How to Find a Good Veterinarian and Groomer.)\n\nEstablish and maintain secure attachments, particularly with people within the home and with other dogs in and about the home and yard, thus fulﬁlling your dog’s need for connection. These attachments are critical to emotional well-being. It is theorized (Palmer & Custance, 2008) that the human-dog bond may be similar to an infant’s attachment to a parent; thus we use the term pet parent. The brain chemistry expressed in the human- dog bond is rooted in mutual attraction governed by the reward system in bonding. Ethologists in the 1990’s showed that dogs have patterns of attachment to humans similar to the mother-infant relationship (Topal et al., 1998). Another notable study demonstrates that the quality of a dog’s relationships to people is critical to the dog’s social behaviors and also affects problem-solving abilities (Topal et al., 1997). A research study demonstrates that both children and dogs are affected in their performance on cognitive tests by having a secure base (Horn et al., 2013). Dogs use the pet parent as the secure base for interactions with the environment, similarly, as do children.",

Although the effects of negative early experiences may be mitigated later in life, they are often difﬁcult if not impossible to eliminate. Thus, the single most important factor of the human-puppy relationship is bonding and becoming a secure base for your dog. The four attachment styles are: Secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful- avoidant. Renowned anthrozoologist, Dr. John Bradshaw, points out that biologists have been reluctant to use the term love to describe the bond between a dog and pet parent, so they typically call it “attachment” (Bradshaw, 2011).\n\nThe Hierarchy of Dog Needs includes love as an essential Emotional Need of dogs. This break-through concept has signiﬁcant implications and offers scientiﬁcally and empirically supported rationales. It is not just that we love our dogs, but that our dogs need our love. Love is an action word. To love a dog is to treat a dog with compassion, that is, seeking to understand what makes dogs “tick” and to remain steadfastly loyal to them. Ensuring that their social-emotional well-being is met day in, and day out is the number one priority—rather than treating dogs as virtual captives, born to do our bidding making us happy for as long as is convenient for us.",

Multiple studies demonstrate that the same systems are activated when dogs interact with us as between people who are in love. Oxytocin is called the love hormone in humans. The scholarly study by Kis et al., (2014) concluded that the oxytocin system also mediates the social behavior of dogs towards people. Oxytocin is essential not only in maternal bonding, but in stress-reduction and social cooperation.\n\nThe famed neuroscientist, Dr. Gregory Berns, describes the purpose of his work, “to understand the dog-human relationship from the dog’s in his breakthrough book, How Dogs Love Us: A perspective” Neuroscientist and His Adopted Dog Decode the Canine Brain (2013). Berns’ research was motivated by the death of his dog Newton. Berns wanted to learn if Newton had loved him the way he had loved Newton. He wanted to ﬁnd out what dogs are thinking and feeling. Berns’ discovered that the dog brain looks and functions much like the human brain in some enlightening and analogous ways. His work provides us with a physical description of what happens in a dog’s brain when the dog has a pleasant association with “their” person.\n\nDr. Berns’ work in fMRI’s (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) with unrestrained awake dogs measured cognitive changes in the dog’s brain activity, mapping the neurological basis for individual preferences. Dr. Berns’ book, How Dogs Love Us (2013) is based upon research from his Dog Project (2012–2016).",

The data strongly suggests dogs love us and miss us when we are gone. In a Psychology Today interview with Dr. Marc Bekoff, Berns tells us, “These data can be further used to move us away from simplistic, reductionist behaviorist explanations of animal behavior and animal emotions and also be used to protect dogs and other animals from being abused” (Berns in Bekoff 2013, para. 9). Bekoff states in no uncertain terms, “Move over, B. F. Skinner and those who defy and deny what we know by continuing to claim that people who say that other animals have rich and deep emotional lives are being overly sentimental and soft, anthropomorphic and non-scientiﬁc: They are wrong” (Bekoff, 2013, para. 10). Professor Berns concurs with other leading researchers in animal emotions, “Now using the MRI to push away the limitations of behaviorism, we can no longer hide from the evidence.

According to a study published in Animal Cognition, dogs may express empathic concern and comfort-offering behaviors (Custance & Mayer, 2012). Rather than approaching the typical source of comfort, the pet parent, dogs approached strangers who were pretending to cry, and started snifﬁng, nuzzling, and licking them.\n\nIn the chapter entitled “For the Love of a Dog” in his book The Genius of Dogs: How Dogs are Smarter Than You Think (2013), Dr. Brian Hare asserts, “Despite the abuse dogs suffer at our hands, no other species is as loyal to the human race as a dog. Dogs behave like children in various ways: following their owners around, vocalizing to get their attention, and clinging to them when they are unsure.” Hare’s research shows that gentle petting decreases cortisol and releases chemicals in the dog’s brain, producing feelings of calmness and affection.",

The hormone and neurotransmitter oxytocin is often referred to as the “trust hormone” because it facilitates bonding. Trust takes time to establish and is easily broken. Sadly, when trust is broken it may seriously damage the relationship and is often irreparable. Establishing and evenly maintaining trust with your dog could not be more important to their emotional health.\n\nAssessing your dog’s emotional trust level leads to a better understanding of your dog’s propensity to experience joy as well as fear, or the likelihood of displaying aggressive behavior.\n\nTrust is inversely related to anxiety and distress. Anything that threatens homeostasis causes stress. In a study in the Journal of Comparative Medicine entitled, “Animal Well-being II: Stress and Distress”, Calpin tells us, “Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis.

You may know a situation is not a threat, but your dog is not functioning with the same complex cognitive abilities that humans have acquired. In addition, remember, you do not meet other dogs eye-to-eye as your dog does. Another dog may be loudly broadcasting threat signals to your dog that go unnoticed or may be misinterpreted by you. The threat may be quite real for your dog: it may be the human perception that is not in line with reality! As trusted caretakers and pet parents, you need to become experts in recognizing potential stressors for your dog. This is commonly referred to as avoiding trigger stacking in dog training. Real and perceived threats to your dog’s well-being often lead to abnormal and maladaptive disorders.\n\nEmotional and biological well-being are enhanced by your dog’s familiarity with the environment, including dog and human social groups, and also by predictable changes in the environment. When you increase predictability that can be trusted, stress decreases. The result is an increased\n\nsense of joy and well-being and often a decrease in fearful behaviors in your dog. Both learning ability and memory impairment are associated with stress, as is long-term depression. Immune dysfunction and shortened lifespan related to disease processes have been shown in research to have a negative effect on health and longevity (Dreschel, 2010).",

The high rate at which dogs are surrendered to shelters, breaking the bond of trust, raises serious ethical questions. Since all healthy relationships are based on trust, the obligation to build a secure and lasting attachment with your dog is a must (Hens, 2009).\n\nBoth acute and chronic stressors should be regularly and competently assessed with an open heart. As your dog’s caregiver, you are your dog’s safe haven both physically and emotionally. You want to show your dog that your home is safe, and that the world is a wonderful place to live.\n\nDogs love routines. It is important to us, as sentient creatures, to be able to predict outcomes. It is equally important that your dog is able to predict outcomes because your dog is dependent upon you. Dogs thrive when daily events are predictable, and when your mood is consistent when you communicate with them. Just as routines are helpful for people to maintain emotional stability, it is even more so with your dog. Continuity and stability go hand-in-glove. Continuity is the ﬂip side of novelty. So much of your dog’s life is controlled. Providing activities that your dog loves and can expect to occur, such as scavenging breakfast, walk time, and chew hour; gives your dog a sense of control over an otherwise seemingly chaotic, or boring environment. Predictability lends itself to emotional security. Dependable secure attachment lays the groundwork in forming healthy relationships. Consistency in emotional attachments formed in early puppyhood is essential for your adolescent and adult dog to thrive. Consistency accelerates the learning process for your dog.",

Yet, positive does not mean permissive.

Indeed, harsh methods have\n\ndeleterious effects on your dog which are far-reaching and may be irreversible. Do No Harm Dog Training is not only safer and more humane, but it is more effective than aversive training and it is relatively easy for anyone to learn.

Nothing shouts “I have no skill” like a trainer who uses shock, prong, or choke collars—and pain or dominance with dogs.\n\nWe already have all of the resources our dogs want and need.

Landsberg, DVM, DACVB and author of “Social Behavior of Dogs” in the Merck Veterinary Manual, reports that relationships with people are not established by dominant/submissive signaling but are a result of genetics and shaped by learning (Landsberg, 2020). As a result of human intervention and selective breeding, humans have bred biddability in our dogs, so it is our responsibility to follow through and care for their emotional well-being with a lifetime of commitment and gentle care, even when the going gets tough, or when we are having a bad day. Bradshaw (2011, p. 171) reminds us, “Since we humans have programmed this vulnerability, it’s our responsibility to ensure that our dogs do not suffer as a result.”",

What are the genetically determined social bonds that exist between dogs? The propensity for bonding in dogs runs deep because “All dogs are domesticated wolves” (Saﬁna, 2015, p. 222). Wolves have complex social structures. Many wolf races have the most complex form of social organization among wild canids, that is, the pack. The pack is typically comprised of related individuals with just one male and one female breeding at a time while the other members assist in raising the young. Co-operation is essential in the\n\nrearing of young and is also involved in co-operative group hunting (Serpell, 2007). High social attentiveness and tolerance in wolves are believed to be an important factor in the evolution of cooperative dog- human relationships (Range & Viranyi, 2015). Similarly, with dogs, these social behaviors may be genetically driven (Saﬁna, 2015).\n\nHowever, domesticated dogs are genetically altered from their naturally evolved wild ancestors. Dogs often live lives of isolation from one another. The range of diversity across breeds suggests there may be other social system differences between breeds. Similarities in wolf-like traits vary, as do social behaviors from one situation to another. These factors make designing within and between group interactions difﬁcult to research.",

Puppies learn bite inhibition from other puppies and older puppy-friendly dogs during fair play. Learning bite inhibition helps to prevent miscommunication and overstepping boundaries with other dogs. Dogs may form secure attachment bonds with other dogs similar to the secure attachment bonds they ideally form with humans. Rightly matched individuals and groups of dogs generally bond. A fearful dog can learn to overcome fear from a more conﬁdent dog. One dog may help another dog grieve loss.\n\nTo develop and maintain social relationships, clear and effective communication between two dogs or the members of a cohort group is essential. Communication and relationships between dogs (intraspeciﬁc aka within the species) are established through visual signals, vocalization, scent, and pheromones. Visual signals include body posture, tail and ear carriage, facial expressions, and piloerection. It may be very challenging for a dog to accurately interpret the signals of other dogs because of selective breeding and the wide variation in body morphology across breeds, breed behavioral traits, cropped ears, and docked tails.\n\nA failure to understand your dog’s social developmental needs may lead to a lifetime of heartache for you both.

Play is biologically, emotionally, socially, and cognitively beneﬁcial to your dog. Dr. Stuart Brown, founder of the United States National Institute of Play is clear about the mental health imperative of play. He tells us, “The opposite of play is not work—the opposite of play is depression” (Brown, 2008, TED). Dr. Mechtild Kaufer in the highly rated book, Canine Play Behavior (2013) tells us that frequent players have lower cortisol levels and typically live life in a more relaxed manner, whereas, dogs raised in isolation suffer from a permanent reduction in their dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin levels, in the long term. Carefree social contact involving tactile stimuli such as physical contact that includes petting, stimulates the release of oxytocin and helps bond dogs to each other and to us. Thus, for your dog to truly thrive, you must begin recognizing play as a need.\n\nYour dog can work off excess energy during play and get those endorphins ﬂowing whether your dog is playing with you or another dog. Play is great physical exercise, increases coordination and keeps your dog in tip-top shape while practicing dodging, running away, and chasing. These valuable skills are adaptive to survival.\n\nOne indispensable beneﬁt of play is learning how to cooperate, trust, and be fair to others by learning social rules. Play requires self-control and teaches empathy. Fair play facilitates resiliency. Play trains dogs for the unexpected challenges in life within a typically low-risk setting, creating greater emotional ﬂexibility in your dog, enhancing the ability to cope, and navigate fear-inducing conditions.",

(Bekoff, 2008)\n\nThere are discrete, concrete things to look for and recognize in appropriate play between dogs whether on a playdate or at a dog park. Do not listen to people who tell you to “Let them work it out.” It is your responsibility to protect your dog’s physical and emotional well-being when it comes to play. Normal, healthy play can be rowdy, noisy, and include body slamming, gestures, and vocalizations that may frighten pet parents. There are very speciﬁc things to put on your “acceptable” or “caution/ danger” list.

Seligman (born 1942), is known best for his break-through research on learned helplessness, happiness, and resilience. Seligman further conducted experiments demonstrating that mental events are causal. His research opened the door to the study of cognition, contrary to the theory and practice of the radical behaviorists of his time (Schultz & Schultz, 2008). Cognitive scientists illustrated that the rich internal lives of dogs are more complex than can be understood or explained through Skinnerian consequences and Pavlovian responses.

Examples of dogs’ intelligence include understanding human gestures, learning new words, facility at communicating, making inferences, and recruiting help and cooperation with others. Dr. John P. Pilley helped redeﬁne intelligence in dogs by teaching his dog, Chaser, the names of more than a thousand different objects by means of exclusion.

Hare’s Citizen Science enterprise, Dognition, has analyzed a large amount of data from pet parents. The array of data collected help researchers understand dogs more quickly and on a much broader scale than single studies typically do. There are 5 cognitive dimensions: Empathy, communication, memory, reasoning, and cunning. Hare discovered that each dog has a unique set of cognitive skills and a style to navigate their environment and the world. Some dogs are great communicators, some have great memories and yet others are best at the connecting with their humans (Hare, 2020).",

For example, the standard human IQ test predicts the likelihood of success in college through reading comprehension, mathematical, and analytical skills measures. In addition, some people have enhanced athletic intelligence, some have emotional intelligence, and some have powerful memories or navigational skills, while others are mechanically inclined geniuses. However, we should not make the mistake of assessing dog intelligence by human measures because when we do, we miss out on celebrating how intelligence actually manifests in our captivatingly unique dogs.\n\nA wolf’s skills needed for survival and thriving cannot be fairly compared to the skills needed by humans. Our dogs are domesticated wolves. Being socialized to humans, dogs are generally more exploratory with less fear of novel objects, known as decreased neophobia. Decreased neophobia has led to a correlation between human socialization and problem-solving abilities (Reid, 2019). Dr. Brian Hare, a leading scientist in animal cognition, tells us in The Genius of Dogs: How Dogs are Smarter Than You Think, “Learning is just one type of intelligence” (Hare & Woods, 2013). Hare’s Dognition study reveals that compared to other mammals, dogs are at a genius level in comprehending and at signaling others with body language and vocalizations, learning new words, understanding their audiences’ perspective, copying other actions, and recruiting help from others.",

The aversive and professional transparency in advertising, deliver the optimum dog-friendly care and training that our dogs need and deserve. Learning force-free training is also easier for pet parents. We now know that the fear of pain is traumatizing for our dogs, just as it would be for us. The chronic stress of never knowing when punishment may occur creates distrust of humans in dogs and leads to bites. The so-called “balanced trainer” who practices a mix of punishment and rewards is a contradiction of terms. Alternating rewards with punishment creates distress in our dogs and has been shown to interfere with learning and relationships and may be a cause of aggression.\n\nAll behavioral terms and activities are rooted in scientiﬁc deﬁnitions for practical usage, so everyone involved in academic discussion is on the same page. Leaders in each ﬁeld of study deﬁne new concepts resulting in a collectively agreed upon deﬁnition known as an operational deﬁnition. Scientiﬁcally and operationally deﬁning force-free dog training establishes common ground and sets the stage for educating and teaching the broader community on emerging best practices within the ﬁeld.",

Polsky (2000) describes severe attacks on humans by dogs who were being trained or maintained on electric shock fences, euphemistically marketed as invisible fences. The promise of fast results may appeal to pet parents. Guaranteed quick results are often touted as a beneﬁt of using punitive dog training methods.

So, a rat is placed in a small chamber, and the rat hears a sound, and if nothing happens the rat begins to ignore the sound, but if the sound is paired with electric shock - and you only have to do this one time - then the rat develops a fear of the sound because it predicts the electric shock. And this becomes a lifelong fear. As long as you present the sound to the rat again, as long as the rat lives, the rat will be afraid of this sound unless you’ve done things during the rat’s life to weaken that stimulus. But even if you weaken it through, for example, extinction processes, the fear always comes back. The fear is almost, more or less, permanent and is a characteristic of the animal for the rest of its life in one way or another [emphasis added]. (LeDoux, 2011).\n\nThe widely cited Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) study measured the behavioral and physiological impact on dogs when shock collars were used during training compared to the impact on dogs when no shock was used. This study demonstrated that dog welfare was negatively impacted with training conducted by professional shock collar trainers (The Department for Environmental Food and Rural Affairs, 2010). BanShockCollars.ca (2007) provides an updated list of numerous scientiﬁc studies supporting the movement to ban shock collars worldwide.

It would take a great deal of effort and time, moreover, it would not be reliable. If the right rabbit crossed your dog’s path, your dog may take chase and never look back.

Positive reinforcement increases the likelihood a behavior will be performed in the future because a reward was given after a behavior was practiced in the past. Therein, the frequency or intensity, that is, the strength of the desired behavior is increased through positive reinforcement.\n\nA positive reinforcer is typically something your dog seeks out. A reinforcer must increase the frequency, intensity, or duration of a behavior, or maintain a behavior as the consequence of something being added, that is, a reward. Thus, the reinforcer is in the eye of beholder. Keep in mind that what you think will be reinforcing as opposed to what your dog actually ﬁnds reinforcing may be two different things.

That is, differential reinforcement increases the probability of the frequency a desirable behavior while at the same time it decreases the probability of an undesirable behavior (Burch & Bailey, 1999). DR redirects the unwanted behavior. When choosing a differential reinforcement protocol decide ﬁrst whether your goal is decreasing the frequency of the behavior, such as excessive barking, or replacing one behavior with another, such as sitting instead of jumping on you and your guests. Successive approximation, or shaping is a form of differential reinforcement (Skinner, 1953).

(See Chapter 16, Greetings, and No Jump.) Differential Reinforcement for an Alternate behavior (DRA) DRA reduces the frequency of an undesirable behavior by reinforcing a different and alternate, but not incompatible behavior. DRA demonstrates to your dog that desirable behaviors result in rewards, while undesirable behaviors do not. Example: For barking, reward your dog for an alternate behavior such as lying down instead of barking. This teaches that lying down earns the reinforcement whereas barking does not. Your dog can still bark while lying down but is less likely to do so. Differential Reinforcement for Other behavior (DRO) (DRO) change in the rate of behavior or no undesired behavior in a predetermined amount of time (Psychology Dictionary Professional Reference, 2019). DRO reduces the frequency of an unwanted behavior by providing periodic reinforcements only if the dog does something different than the undesirable behavior for a given amount of time, intensity, or duration. DRO is also known as omission training procedure. Example: When your dog whines at the dinner table, reward your dog every ﬁve minutes for lying in bed or playing with a toy. This teaches that lying in bed or playing with a toy is more reinforcing than whining. Differential Reinforcement for Lower frequency behavior (DRL) DRL is the lesser rate, that is, lesser frequency of an undesired behavior in a predetermined amount of time.

We want to reinforce something that is innately useful to the dog. If we just switch one behavior for a different behavior even when using positive reinforcement, we risk ignoring the need for relief-seeking that prompted the original behavior” (Hale, 2021).\n\nNote: Ignoring behavior as the singular treatment for the purpose of extinction is typically effective only in laboratory settings where other confounding variables are controlled. In real life, however, intervening variables such as other reinforcements in the environment affect behavior. For example, if your dog jumps up on you and you ignore your dog by turning your back, your dog may be content in jumping at your back to touch you. Perhaps you did not turn quite fast enough, or the movement of turning away further aroused your dog. Importantly, we do not purposely use extinction techniques alone in force-free training. Extinction alone often causes frustration and stress for your dog.\n\n“To change emotion: Create new associations” (Michaels, 2015/2020). From The Hierarchy of Dog Needs [Pyramid Graphic].",

This type of learning occurs when a neutral stimulus (such as the sound of a bell) is paired with another stimulus (food). The sound of the bell becomes associated and reﬂexively connected with the delivery of food. Therefore, a dog who previously salivated for food alone (unconditioned response) will salivate at the sound of the bell, without the presentation of food (conditioned response). One event becomes a reliable predictor of another event occurring, teaching the dog that the ﬁrst event predicts the second event. The dog learns to have an anticipatory reaction to the ﬁrst event.\n\nPavlov’s work demonstrates that hormonal glands and reﬂexes govern involuntary behavior. Animals experience many of these events as emotions (Chance, 2014). Increased heart rate, increased respiration rate, and even immune system responses are reﬂexes. Emotions are changes\n\ninvoluntary; however, associative learning can modify an emotion called a Conditioned Emotional Response (CER). Conditioned “reﬂexes” are not inborn but rather learned. Learned reﬂexes may vary dependent upon conditions and are subject to behavior modiﬁcation (Chance, 2014).

First, let’s look at respondent learning, also known as classical conditioning or Pavlovian conditioning. With respondent conditioning new eliciting stimuli, not new behaviors, are learned. This learning occurs through the process of repeated and close pairing of a neutral stimulus with an existing conditioned stimulus. This is the stimulus- stimulus-response (S-S-R) learning, and it is this process that accounts for responses through associations such as the elicitation of salivating at the sound of a tin of food opening. It is also through this S-S-R process that emotional reactions are triggered such as a change in heart rate. In this same way, fear or calmness are elicited by conditioned stimuli (N. Tudge, personal communication, 2015).\n\nFrom A History of Modern Psychology (Schultz & Schultz, 2008, p. 287), we learn Pavlov also tested buzzers, lights, whistles, tones, bubbling water, and metronomes with the same results. Pavlov, in his own words taught us that, “Footfalls of a passer-by, chance conversations in neighboring rooms, slamming of a door, or vibration of a passing van, street cries, even shadows cast into the windows of the room,” are all variables that change the nature of the association learned (Pavlov, 1927).\n\nExample: The leash becomes associated with going for a walk. This is why your dog gets excited when you pull out the leash.\n\nExample: Crinkling the bag of dog treats becomes associated with treats, so crinkling the bag of dog treats can be used as a Recall cue all by itself!",

Counterconditioning reverses the effects of unwanted conditioned responses by teaching new associations (Chance, 2014).\n\nExample: Counterconditioning creates a new association to an already established one. If a previously learned association paired the sound of the doorbell with strangers appearing at the door, teach a new association pairing the sound of the doorbell with something your dog loves. For example, if your dog barks at the door when the doorbell rings, countercondition the sound of the doorbell by pairing it with hot dog bits delivered on the back patio. With multiple pairings, your dog learns to respond to the sound of the doorbell by happily running to the back patio for hot dogs!\n\nMultiple pairings are typically required but not in the case of learning fears. Fear can be learned in just one single exposure called one-trial learning. For example, in shock training, dogs may associate people, places or things with being shocked. Unrelated or unintended associations, such as a child walking by your dog can become an unexpected, an unintended, and unwanted learned association. The dog may now fear children because the dog associates children with being shocked.",

    "page_content": "Dr. Karen Overall (2013, p. 581–584) created a “Relaxation Protocol” as a foundation for desensitization and counterconditioning where the physical changes associated with relaxation are rewarded. First, the dog learns to perfectly focus on the pet parent or trainer for 15 seconds, preferably lying down. Then, in a slowly, graduating format, duration, distance and distractions are increased. The protocol teaches dogs to accept everything from the handler answering the doorbell, to the absence of the handler for a short time. The dog is rewarded every second or third task. If signs of anxiety or stress are observed, the pet parent or trainer immediately returns to an easier step where the dog was successful, showing no anxiety, or the they both take a break from training.\n\nThe combined terms, Desensitization and Counterconditioning, referred to as D&CC, are frequently used in concert in force-free dog training. In desensitization training, the dog learns not to react to stimuli that slowly and incrementally increases in intensity. In counterconditioning the dog learns a different emotional response, and may learn “response substitution” i.e., a different behavioral response than the current reaction to the stimulus. This combination of techniques may result in both emotional and behavioral modiﬁcation.\n\nIn the dog trainers’ classic, resource guarding treatment book Mine (2002), author Jean Donaldson constructs step-by-step desensitization hierarchies for food, object, and location guarding, handling and the generalization of counterconditioned responses to other items and people.",

From The Hierarchy of Dog Needs [Pyramid Graphic].\n\nPreferred Behavior Can Reinforce Less Preferred Behavior\n\nThe Premack Principle method of learning uses a high probability (preferred) behavior to reinforce a low probability (not preferred) behavior. David Premack (1959, 1965) discovered that a reinforcing stimulus, such as food, could also be seen as the behavior of eating food. Understanding the Premack Principle is commonly illustrated by a parent who tells the child to eat their peas ﬁrst (low probability/less preferred) and the child may eat dessert afterwards (high probability/preferred behavior), that is, one behavior can reinforce another behavior. Engaging in one behavior can be used as a reinforcer for increasing the frequency of another behavior (Chance, 2014). Eating dessert is contingent upon eating peas ﬁrst. Here’s an example most people are familiar with that you may already be using— A hungry dog has a high probability for eating treats, but a lower probability of sitting, making the opportunity of eating treats dependent upon sitting and resulting in the reinforcement and increased frequency of\n\nsitting. However, the Premack Principle is not dependent upon a physiological function or primary and secondary reinforcers but on behavior reinforcing behavior.",

Additionally, there may be long-term stress synchronization between a dog and the dog’s human in the home, resulting in the human mental condition affecting the mental condition of their dog.\n\nSocial learning may be especially useful when helping a fearful dog.

Do not give a puppy as a gift to someone who may not be prepared or want to provide a loving forever home.\n\nThe ﬁrst quantitative evidence demonstrating that puppy mills produce puppies with fears, phobias, learning deﬁcits, and a generalized lack of resilience resulting in a seriously impaired ability to cope with normal stressors, was published in Applied Animal Behavior (McMillan et al., 2011).",

According to Kunkel-Jones,\n\nPet parents who desire a physically sound, healthy, happy, sociable puppy are often severely and sadly disappointed after purchasing a puppy. When you purchase a puppy, you may unknowingly support cruel and inhumane treatment of dogs. While no puppy seller will admit to sourcing a puppy from a mill, the sad fact is that puppy mills are big business and a major supplier of puppies. Breeding is done regardless of genetic heath issues, both visible and invisible, from deformed body parts to elbow, knee, hip, and eye problems. Female dogs are typically bred every heat cycle until they can no longer produce, then they are killed, dumped, or sold. (Kunkel-Jones, 2019, para. 7, 9)",

    "page_content": "Health care is virtually non-existent, and most dogs spend their entire lives in dirty, cramped wire cages without any kind of enrichment. In many puppy mills, wire cages are stacked upon each other so waste falls onto the dogs below. Cages are often dirty, and food is of the poorest quality. Diseases and parasites are prevalent, including those communicable to humans. Proper veterinary care is an expense that eats into the bottom line. In addition, cruel practices such as medical procedures without anesthesia are practiced. Puppies are shipped all over the country, taken from mothers at an early age and often subjected to inhumane treatment in transport. When dogs exhaust their usefulness, they are rarely euthanized humanely. Shooting, drowning, and beating are common. The “lucky” ones are dumped at shelters. (Kunkel-Jones, 2019)\n\nAvoid supporting online puppy mills that typically ship a puppy to you. The ﬁrst step is to verify the breeding protocols so you receive a healthy puppy. Just like people, the best predictors of puppy health are the longevity of parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Temperament is genetic and personality is the result of how that temperament is modiﬁed by socialization and the dog’s environment.\n\nThe best breeders raise puppies indoors around a variety of people, including strangers and children outside of the immediate family. The best breeders also safely introduce puppies to other puppy-friendly dogs outside\n\nof the litter and the home, so all puppies are given the necessary opportunities to become both people and dog friendly.",

The safest and most effective methods are based on force-free/pain-free/fear-free scientiﬁc principles. The consequences of using other methods include a high risk of psychological and medical injury, which are entirely unnecessary. No truly competent trainer recommends inﬂicting pain, fear, dominance or intimidation, shock, prong or choke collars.\n\nThe highly regarded and inﬂuential American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (2021b) takes an outspoken and principled stand on equipment and techniques that should be avoided in dog training. They report,\n\nAn appropriate trainer should avoid any use of training tools that involve pain (choke chains, prong collars, or electronic shock collars), intimidation (squirt bottles, shaker noise cans, compressed air cans, shouting, staring, or forceful manipulations such as “alpha rolls” or “dominance downs”), physical correction techniques (leash jerking, physical force), or\n\nﬂooding (“exposure”). The learner must always feel safe and have the ability to “opt out” of training sessions.

The use of equipment causing stress or pain, such as choke, prong, or electronic shock collars is antithetical to Do No Harm training and is harmful to dogs. These devices are at odds with pet parents developing positive relationships with their dogs and may cause aggression or worsen aggression (Overall, 2006). Additionally, medical research shows stress to the neck causes injuries that include spinal cervical injury, burst capillaries in the eyeballs, foreleg nerve damage, impaired breathing, and damage that affects the function of the esophagus and trachea. A regular ﬂat collar is recommended to hold identiﬁcation tags only. Do not attach a leash to a ﬂat collar—pressure from pulling on a ﬂat\n\ncollar may cause medical injuries as well. Make leash-walking fun and relaxing. Recommended equipment includes:\n\nHarness. An X or Y shaped harness across the breast has the least impact on movement and mobility and provides the most comfort for your dog. A front, back, or double-clip harness is recommended for all dogs and puppies, including those dogs that have developed a habit of pulling on the leash during the walk. A harness that attaches to the leash at the breastplate is ﬁne to start, although some trainers prefer the back-clip. There are beneﬁts and drawbacks to each. Small dogs that do not pull may prefer a step-in harness. Flat collar. Use for identiﬁcation tags. Leash. Use a leash that is four or six feet in length. When you begin training, a short leash may be helpful for dogs that are difﬁcult to walk. However, using a long (long line), very loose leash for training helps if your dog is reactive.",

Jean Donaldson has this to say about trainers who are adamantly self-righteous about withholding the pleasure of food, “The sad objective of these trainers seems to be to reach the end of the dog’s life having dispensed as few rewards as possible. It’s difﬁcult to explain why an animal trainer would strive to be as stingy as possible, given the evidence of how powerful and safe positive reinforcement is” (Donaldson as cited in Pierson, 2015, p. 255).",

Shelters have the difﬁcult, if not impossible, task of trying to ﬁnd good homes for dogs who cannot get along with other dogs. As early as 2004, renowned veterinarian, RK Anderson, published an open letter to his veterinary colleagues titled “Puppy Vaccination and Early Socialization Should Go Together”.

It states that, “Because the ﬁrst three months are the period when sociability outweighs fear, this is the primary window of opportunity for puppies to adapt to new people, animals, and experiences” (2008, para. 2).

The Pet Professional Guild (2012) offers a terriﬁc one-page socialization guide with a checklist on one side and a “how-to” on the other side.\n\nWork closely with your veterinarian to keep your puppy current on her vaccinations or titer testing but remain proactive about socialization requirements. Discuss the current scientiﬁc literature and create a medically safe early socialization plan with your vet and a private trainer or puppy class instructor or ask your positive reinforcement behavioral consultant for a socialization-savvy veterinary referral.\n\nChoosing a compassionate veterinarian who practices gentle handling and restraint is one of the most critical decisions you will ever make for your dog. Find a pet-centered clinic with a veterinarian where your dog comes ﬁrst. Force-free handling and Fear Free® visits should go hand-in-glove. Cooperative veterinary care is a team effort. When pet parents feel comfortable with the guidance given by their gentle veterinarian, they are more likely to practice maintenance care at home between visits.",

Request a dogs-only grooming room, if possible, so your dog is not triggered by the smell of cats or prey animals. Have the groomer in the room before you and your dog enter.\n\nLet your dog sniff the instruments. Ask your groomer to allow your dog to initiate interaction when ready, not vice-versa. Allow your dog to show you readiness for grooming. Do not force. Find a groomer who will groom your dog in your lap or on the ﬂoor if possible. Be sure your dog is on a non-slip surface. Bring your dog to the groomer a bit hungry. Ask your groomer to avoid direct eye contact as much as possible if your dog is fearful. If you have a small dog that may be aggressive, ask your groomer to use an air muzzle, that is, a ball that resembles a deep diver’s helmet with an opening in the front, rather than a tightly ﬁtting piece of cloth that frightens your dog and can impedes the ability to breath. Alternatively, use a basket muzzle. Do not hurry.",

Dogs should be self-imposing breaks from play to rest or get a small drink. Breaks may include snifﬁng.

If play becomes too rough the adult dog typically simply walks away, effectively ending the fun, therein, teaching the puppy what is appropriate and what is not.

Dog play and dog parks should be safe, fun and a source of enjoyment for both you and your dog. Watch your dog’s behavior and body language carefully. Pat Miller, Training Editor for the Whole Dog Journal, tells us that at least half of the problems seen at the dog parks stem from inappropriate human behavior. It is the pet parent’s responsibility to observe and monitor their dog’s interactions at all times.

A variety of scents your dog can self-select, such as ornamental grasses, different textures, a bed of hay, tiered levels, digging pits, a fountain or a kiddie pool, trails, hollow logs, and bird feeders can make a world of difference at home as well. Sensory gardens are also mentally stimulating, building conﬁdence in your dog.\n\nApril Bove-Rothwell, former gorilla trainer and enrichment expert for the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park, and Do No Harm intern graduate, wrote this salient piece, adapted from her BARKS from the Guild trade magazine article (2016, July).\n\nThe overall goal of enrichment is to increase the behavioral repertoire of an animal. Enrichment goes far beyond just encouraging natural behaviors; it has the power to modify behavior when carefully planned and executed. Speciﬁc goals may include increasing natural behaviors like food foraging in order to increase activity. Observing and evaluating your dog’s response to enrichment is crucial to assess if it is meeting the goals of a behavior modiﬁcation program.\n\nEnvironmental enrichment is an effective behavior modiﬁcation tool that is often overlooked. Providing a stimulating environment enhances the physical and psychological well-being of an animal by allowing them to express the range of behaviors typical of their species.

Cut a running path around the perimeter of your secured property, run the trail with your dog and you may ﬁnd your dog doing zoomies on the trail without you! Tiered levels. Use hay bales or hollow logs to allow your dog to get a better view of the lay of the land. Dogs love to perch on high. Bird feeders. If you have dogs who may be stressed by visiting birds, hang bird feeding stations up high so that your dog can watch, putting the safety of the birds ﬁrst. Sniffer patch.

If you wonder what is going on in your dog’s head, and long to communicate interactively, here is a sureﬁre way of connecting. Reading body language sharpens your ability to understand what your dog is feeling and communicating. Learn to read what your dog is saying to you and learn to speak to in a language your dog can understand. A wonderful and endearing characteristic of dogs is that dogs are truly honest and authentic about showing their feelings—they do not lie. Dogs wear their feelings on their sleeves!\n\nBody language is the communicative bridge between you and your dog. Start by listening rather than doing. Listen ﬁrst, before doing anything to understand your dog’s state of mind, whether fearful or happy. Your dog’s body language is broadcasting clear giveaways to their feelings. Hone your observational skills to decode your dog’s messages. Do not ignore those messages. Respond with clear hand signals for effective communication. Dr. Lynn Honeckman, veterinary behavior expert explains, “We can learn to read the body language of dogs displaying happiness, curiosity, anxiety, fear and hostility. Even learning the basics of interpreting a dog displaying ‘approachable’ versus ‘stay away’ body language can be of the greatest beneﬁt” (personal communication, 2015).\n\nBehaviors, such as hiding, freezing, or trying to move away in the opposite direction lets you know something is seriously wrong and change is needed.

Flooding with a frightening stimulus leads to attempts at running away, hiding, or to a shutdown. These responses are your dog shouting, “PLEASE STOP, I’M SCARED.” Victoria Stilwell, star of Animal Planet’s It’s Me or the Dog, explains what happens in situations where your dog is ﬂooded with aversive stimulus and cannot escape. “In the majority of cases, ﬂooding only makes a dog more anxious and forces the dog to adopt different coping mechanisms such as ﬁghting or shutting down—where the\n\ndog becomes almost numb to the environment and behaves in a way that is truly out of character—an instinct that keeps him safe and ensures survival” (Stilwell, 2020. para. 4).\n\n“Training collars” are designed for handler convenience or employing dominance tactics causing pain or choking the dog. These types of harmful tools are used as handler short-cuts or restraint. Anger, frustration, egotistical “showing off,” or fearfulness on the part of the handler can result in harsh treatment where the dog experiences paralyzing fear. To the untrained eye, the dog may appear to be in a state of calm acceptance. In reality, misused equipment, intimidation, or restraint may cause a condition called tonic immobility, wherein fear is mistaken and mislabeled as “good behavior.” Tonic immobility is a condition of unresponsiveness occurring during signiﬁcant stress. Tonic immobility may occur at a training facility, lesson, or class, at home, or in any situation where a dog is frightened. Charging ahead to get a frightening task “over with” such as grooming or a veterinary visit can easily backﬁre, resulting in fear, aggression, anxiety, escape and avoidance behavior, or tonic immobility.",

In the wild, tonic immobility occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a perceived predator. It sometimes\n\nresembles a posture suggestive of death but still maintaining an awareness of the environment (Fragkaki et al., 2016).\n\nThis handbook guides you in teaching your dog the behaviors you prefer. These preferred behaviors will be the behaviors your dog will naturally repeat to get the things your dog wants. Look for opportunities to say, “Yes!” Pay close attention to behaviors and actively identify and reward the behaviors your dog already does that you ﬁnd desirable.\n\nConsistently reinforced by you, these behaviors will be repeated and become routine automatic responses, and moreover, eventually becoming habits! Here are a couple of rules to help get you started. Consistently reward desirable behaviors to let your dog know, “That’s great.” Practice each manners/obedience behavior 3–4 times a day for 3–4 minutes each session.\n\nReward the behaviors you want repeated. When a dog repeats a behavior, your dog is telling you the behavior was successful in the past to get what was wanted. Determine the relative value of each reward to your dog so you can adjust the delivery of reinforcement more judiciously. The more challenging the behaviors, the higher the reward value required. Changing emotional responses are generally the most challenging of all. Dogs may respond to a variety of reinforcements such as",

Teach an alternate behavior to the undesirable behavior.\n\nIf Your Dog Has Difﬁculty Learning a Behavior, Most Likely\n\nYour technique needs improvement. Your dog does not understand what you want and is unable to read your signals. You are going too fast. Effective, dog-friendly training requires taking baby steps. One of the most common setbacks in training occurs because a pet parent is pushing ahead before their dog is ready to move forward. Your treats are not of high value to your dog. Increase the appetitive value of the food reward.\n\nRaising a new puppy can be a lot of work and you may be lacking sleep. If you ﬁnd yourself getting frustrated with your new puppy, take a break but do not take it out on your puppy. Simply walk away for a few minutes and take a few deep breaths or take your puppy on a walk for some fresh air. You should both be having a good time!\n\nNote: So that we may become a more dog-friendly culture, force-free training has modiﬁed some of the traditional training language in an effort to change the way a pet parent thinks and feels about their relationship with their dog.

Start off on the right paw and get a copy of the puppy primer by Dr. Ian Dunbar, Before and After You Get Your Puppy (2004). If you have added a new puppy or new adult dog to your household who was never reliably housetrained or who has regressed back to making mistakes, it is time to institute or revisit housetraining protocols.\n\nUse a housetraining plan your dog understands. From day one, the key words are containment, both short-term and long-term, and reward opportunities. Conﬁnement in a carefully conditioned crate for night-time and in a small area during the day with an indoor sod tray or puppy pad is recommended until your pup earns more space in your home (See Chapter 22, Doggy Enrichment Land.) Frequent opportunities for elimination with food rewards will have your dog looking forward to getting on the leash to go to the chosen spot in your yard, eliminating for a yummy treat. The number one rule and the basis of force-free training is rewarding for the desired behavior rather than punishing for an undesired behavior. Plan to speed housetraining by devoting at least a long weekend to housetraining protocols. Being consistent about housetraining makes it easy for your puppy or new dog to understand the routine.",

Do carefully condition your puppy or dog to use a metal crate or to a cloth crate on your bed with enough room to stretch out comfortably. When your puppy cries at night, get up and take your puppy to the elimination spot—either a sod tray or puppy pad near the door, or outside. Do not allow your puppy to eliminate in the crate. 2. Do limit your dog’s access to the house during the day unless your dog has recently eliminated. Contain your dog using a playpen with a sod tray or puppy pad when you are housetraining and when you are away from home. You may have a container of sod delivered weekly to your home, or\n\n“do it yourself” purchasing sod from a nursery and using a low-lipped kitty litter tray. An extra bedroom or the kitchen with a baby gate will also do nicely.

Over time, as your puppy becomes housetrained, enlarge your dog’s space. If your dog has an accident, decrease space, but please be kind and expect occasional errors at the start. If your dog pees in his bed area, elevate the bed in the x-pen. Dogs do not like to eliminate where they sleep! Do not allow your dog to roam around your home until your dog earns more space in the home—one room at a time.\n\n3. Do give your puppy a high value treat, then praise exuberantly each time your dog completes elimination in a proper location. Dr. Dunbar recommends giving three treats when elimination is complete. Use very high value treats for these successful events to make a powerful positive\n\nassociation in your dog’s memory and on learning. This is so worth celebrating! Do not ignore the successes. 4. Do remember your puppy is a puppy and will not have full bladder control until 16–20 weeks of age. Do forgive mistakes. Do not be impatient. 5.

Dogs need “occupational therapy,” says Dr. Ian Dunbar, DVM, animal behaviorist and puppy guru. If you do not give your dog something to do, your dog will ﬁnd something to do and that something may be something you may not like.\n\nAlthough dogs are genetically hard-wired to chew, some dogs like chewing more than others.

Habits develop early and quickly, so start training your dog on the ﬁrst day home regardless of your dog’s age.\n\nChewing is a species-speciﬁc, stress-relieving natural canine activity and often soothes teething pain. Favorite chew toys often act as paciﬁers. Chewing is also a great outlet for pent-up energy. Chewing on a great bone can exhaust your dog because it’s such great exercise for the mouth, jaws, and forelimbs as well. Chewing stimulates healthy blood ﬂow to the gums too and can help clean teeth. Lucky for you, chewing also helps distract and redirect your dog away from engaging in unwanted activities.",

More than likely, you are already using the Premack Principle training technique, such as asking your dog to “Sit” before you open the front door. The amount of time and energy you spend training and the number of trials to criterion—how many repetitions are required to reach reliability, will depend in part on the techniques you use. You may ﬁnd a fair and unbiased, well-referenced analysis that examines the beneﬁts and drawbacks to both lure and free- shaped training in, “Are ‘Free-Shaped’ Dogs Better Problem Solvers?” (LeBlanc, 2015).\n\nCapturing a behavior occurs when you recognize and mark a desirable, spontaneously performed behavior with a high value treat: that is, a behavior your dog already naturally performs without any input from you. A mark is a sound, such as a clicker, or the word “Good” indicating the behavior will be reinforced by you. Capturing behavior may be used to train all basic manners skills and quirky behaviors that may otherwise be difﬁcult to train, such as a tilt of the head.

Simple behavior problems such as housesoiling, destructive chewing, and excessive barking, kill dogs. Similarly, biting, ﬁghting, and fearful dogs are hardly happy, or safe to be around, and so there is simply no time to mess around with time-consuming techniques. We must resolve the dogs’ problems, relieve their chronic, yet acute, stress levels, and improve their quality of life using the most time-efﬁcient methods available.

Shaping is a process of teaching a new behavior by ﬁrst reinforcing behaviors resembling the desired behavior, systematically moving toward the goal behavior one small step at a time. Shaping teaches new forms of behaviors building upon older forms of behavior. A dog is rewarded for successive approximations of the end-goal behavior and sometimes given a jackpot of rewards when the end- goal behavior is achieved. A sample using shaping to train is provided in the chapter that teaches “Down.” (See Chapter 16, Basic Skills.)\n\n1. Identify the end-goal desired behavior you would like to teach. 2. Identify a response that can easily be used to begin the shaping sequence.\n\n3. Reward the response. 4. Incrementally require closer approximations to the end-goal behavior, reinforcing each step until the goal is reached.\n\n5. Establish each step ﬁrmly with repetitions before moving on to the next approximation.\n\n6. If your dog “gets lost,” immediately go back to the easier, previous well-known step.\n\nFor example, if you want to teach your dog to lie down on a new rug, use the steps in shaping by rewarding your dog for walking in the direction of the rug, stepping one foot on the rug, then four feet on the rug, sitting on the rug, and then lying down on the new rug.\n\nUnderstanding how to use the Premack Principle in force-free training can help boost your success rate with some of the most difﬁcult problems you may face with your dog. The most common everyday example of the Premack Principle is, “If you eat your vegetables, then you may have dessert.”",

    "page_content": "he end goal of basic manners training is to experience ease and harmony in everyday life with your dog. One possible concern about training with treats is that you may believe your dog will continue requiring treats for learning and performing each behavior. However, this should not be a problem. Smart, competent trainers are experts in preventing treat dependence. Although we train new behaviors on a continuous schedule of reinforcement—one trick, one treat, the schedule changes once a behavior is learned. For some behaviors providing food on a steady or intermittent basis, such as for a reliable recall (Come), is the best practice in maintaining happy voluntary compliance. Food is like money to your dog, and who works for free? Nobody. Operant behaviors are all tricks as far as your dog is concerned. However, some dogs, especially the working and sporting breeds frequently prefer a tug toy to a piece of food.\n\nUse real-life reinforcement, learn how to remove the lure, and discover how linking behaviors can enhance progress, gradually replacing some food rewards with other types of rewards. Begin giving random rewards of affection or praise for a job well done as part of your dog’s daily routines. Use these trainer secrets:\n\nYour dog wants to experience the joys of life just as we humans do. Identify and make use of one of the most powerful rewards: real-life reinforcement. Many dogs prefer play, such as a quick game of tug, over food. Here are some real-life reinforcement ideas to practice with your dog:",

    "page_content": "This is the step where many pet parents make mistakes and falter, and then say that their dog will only perform for treats when food is used as a lure in training. Once the new behavior is learned, stop using the treat as a lure. Instead, use the next treat for a reward. Here’s how: as soon as your dog can perform a behavior by following the treat with the nose (luring), remove the treat from that hand for the next trial. Now, ask for the behavior using the same lure hand-movement you were using. Then after you get the behavior, give the treat from the other hand. You have just taught a hand signal while removing the food lure.\n\nLink two or more well-learned behaviors together in a sequence, then reward. Agility competitions link a series of behaviors together and often provide a tug on a favorite toy at the end of the course as the reward. First, link two behaviors, then three, and then four.\n\nPlaying fetch. “Get It” . . . “Come ”. . . “Drop It”. . .“Sit.” Offer a treat or real-life reward such as quickly throwing the ball again.\n\nReplace some of the treats by gradually substituting with other rewards such as affection, massage, a toy, or an exuberant “good” for desirable behavior, if your dog responds strongly to praise and enthusiasm.

Continue treating after each correct response until your dog performs the behavior consistently when asked. A well- learned behavior will become a reliable response. Reliability in dog training generally means achieving an average success rate of eight out of ten times while keeping in mind that dogs are not robots. As soon as the behavior is well learned, begin treating randomly as random reinforcement is the most powerful type of reinforcement schedule. Your dog will continue offering the learned behaviors as long as you continue providing sufﬁcient intermittent rewards. Here is an example of a sequence of phasing in random rewards:\n\nSit—Treat Sit—Treat Sit—Praise Sit—Treat Sit—Scratch on the chest\n\nBuild on this schedule until your dog gets a food reward one out of ﬁve times on average.

Delay Greetings to Calm\n\nDelay your own greeting until your dog is calm so your greeting does not escalate the adrenaline spike your dog experiences the minute you arrive home. Walk into your home and go about your routine calmly. Greet your dog with calming affection rather than exuberant excitement. Smile and say, “Hello.” Calmly let your dog go outdoors to eliminate. Later, play! Many dogs stop jumping and display decreased symptoms of separation issues when this technique alone is consistently employed, but it can be the hardest behavior for pet parents to change!\n\nStart by managing your dog’s environment to get things under control. If your dog jumps on guests, growls, or shows any stress or aggression, conﬁne your dog as a safety measure for your guests. Do not give your dog the opportunity to jump on or bark at your incoming guests. Give your dog time and space to calm down in a safe place and to accept the arrival of guests in the home before attempting to let your dog greet your guests. Conﬁne your dog to an exercise pen (x-pen), the yard behind a sliding glass door, a guest room, or your kitchen with a retractable gate until your dog is able to greet visitors calmly. Then, bring your dog out on a leash and allow calm greetings to unfold naturally. Have guests toss high value treats to your dog, if safe, to speed and ease the process of acclimation and create a bond between your dog and strangers entering your home. Do not be concerned that this newly learned behavior will stop your dog from guarding your home from intruders. It won’t. Guarding is a genetically driven canid territorial predisposition.",

These outdated methods can backﬁre, causing aggression and may well alter the joyful relationship pet parents want with their dog.\n\nWhat is a pet parent to do?

If you practice consistently, your dog will receive the attention your dog wants for appropriate greeting.\n\nIf your dog is about to leap into your arms uninvited:\n\n1. Treat, praise, and give calm affection for four on the ﬂoor. The instant your dog has all four paws on the ﬂoor, provide a high value treat. If your dog jumps up, stand up straight. These repetitions lead to a “light bulb moment.” If you are patient and your technique is good, your dog will ﬁgure it out. Withdraw interaction such as, touch, words, and eye contact for jumping.

As soon as your dog sees you, consistently walk directly to the “cookie jar” and ask for a “Sit.” Toss the treats in a spray. Make this the new routine for greeting.\n\n4. If your dog comes rushing at you from a distance, teach an alternate behavior to jumping that allows your dog to expend energy. Teach your dog to target your hand by holding your palm down at the height of your dog’s nose and a few inches away from your body. When your dog’s nose touches your hand, reward as long your dog performs the nose-touch, and does not jump. Happy wiggles are encouraged! If jumping continues, use a baby gate as a barrier which can be helpful to practice homecomings without jumping.\n\n5. Take time-outs to relax. Lastly, if your dog jumps up on you or your guests regularly, and you have not trained an alternative behavior yet, set your dog up in a nice area with a chew toy, or time yourself out by leaving.

(Learn more about capturing, luring, and shaping in Chapter 14, Training Techniques.)\n\nCapturing Sit. Capture Sit and provide a reward. Reward sitting whenever your dog sits as a normal part of daily activities! Luring Sit. Use food ﬁrst as a lure and then as a reward. Hand signals are easier to understand than words because dogs are experts at reading body language but not so great at spoken languages. Remove the food lure as soon as possible and transition to food as a reward as soon as you can get a reliable Sit. If you do not remove the food lure promptly, your dog may not learn the behavior but will just follow the treat with the nose and Sit only when you have a treat near the nose. This can be easily avoided by following these steps:\n\n1. Start with your dog facing you on-leash in a quiet location with a minimum of distractions.\n\n2. Show your dog a small, high value treat (the lure) at nose level, and slowly raise it slightly above and then just behind your dog’s head.\n\n3.

Try this:\n\nAsk your dog to “Down” using the hand signal and/or verbal cue. Use a treat to lure your dog’s nose back and around toward the opposite side of your dog’s favored hip. Shape the movement bit by bit. Click/treat the instant your dog rests on the favored hip. Repeat again and again. Remove the treat lure at the very earliest possible trial and begin using the lure as the reward after your dog performs the desired behavior.\n\nTeach your dog to relax by using your dog’s own naturally occurring behavior, capturing and rewarding a Settle Down. The goal is that relaxing becomes an automatic behavior when you sit down or make the Settle Down request. An automatic behavior is also called a default behavior in force-free dog training. Settle Down is highly effective for use in desensitization and counterconditioning when teaching emotional and behavioral modiﬁcation in the face of triggers such as other dogs and wildlife when appropriate thresholds are established.

Wait means “do nothing.” Teach your dog Wait/Stay in the Down position ﬁrst, which is typically more relaxing. This is easier than teaching Sit/Wait or Stand/Wait ﬁrst: these iterations may be added later. You want each and every attempt at Wait to be successful.\n\n1. “Sit,” then “Down.” 2. Give the Wait hand signal: that is, make a ﬁreworks burst type movement with your palm facing toward your dog’s face. Say the word “Wait” at the same instant. Your dog is already doing the behavior of waiting. All you do now is increase the level of difﬁculty.",

Having a long distance outdoor Come cue is very important. Practice so your dog responds quickly and enthusiastically to your call. One of the most popular ways of teaching a Lightning Recall is using a whistle as the signal cue. Standing directly in front of your dog, blow the whistle softly and follow up immediately with a treat. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Next, slowly increase distance and add distractions in small steps, as long as your dog continues to respond reliably. Whistle training is an excellent way to train a lightning recall if and when you reach a safe leash-free recall level.",

The use of equipment causing stress or pain, such as choke, prong, or electronic shock collars, is antithetical to Do No Harm training and is harmful to dogs. These devices are at odds with the positive relationships pet parents are developing with their dogs. Studies show these devices cause, rather than cure aggression, and otherwise worsen behavior. Additionally, medical research shows that pressure on the neck may cause injuries that include cervical spine injury, burst capillaries in the eyeballs, foreleg nerve damage, and damage that affects the function of the esophagus and trachea, causing breathing impairment (Overall et al., 2006). A standard ﬂat collar is acceptable to hold identiﬁcation tags but not as the attachment point for the leash.\n\nWear your treat bag or carry a pocketful of high value treats such as cheese bits or hot dogs while teaching leash-walking so your dog develops a habit of focusing and connecting with you while on leash.\n\nMost right-handed pet parents walk their dogs on their left side, leaving their right hand free to open doors, greet others, or carry a package. Professionals typically walk dogs on their left side. However, choose whichever side you are most comfortable with and be consistent. Ideally, choose the side to walk your dog that everyone in your family agrees upon.\n\nThe easiest way of achieving successful leash-walking begins by starting down the right path with the right equipment early in your dog’s life: however, loose-leash walking may be learned at any age.

An X, Y, or H style harness provides the best mobility, prevents chaﬁng, and allows free movement of the limbs and proper gait. Some trainers prefer the back clip on these styles because of possible mobility and gait issues. Small dogs that do not pull may prefer a step-in harness. Most veterinarians strongly recommend a harness rather than a collar for all brachycephalic breeds with a short muzzle. These dogs are already susceptible to upper respiratory breathing issues, so they breathe easier without the added pressure of a collar around the neck, as do all dogs.\n\nA four or six-foot leash is recommended for leash-walking contingent upon your dog’s skill and the situation.

Change direction the instant you feel pressure from your dog on the leash: stop, plant your feet, and pivot, making a 180-degree turn in place and begin walking again, while saying “Let’s Go” (see below). Click/treat when your dog is at the correct location after catching up to you. If you allow your dog to pull you, you are inadvertently reinforcing pulling during walks and your dog responds by pulling harder. Your consistency in not following your pulling dog is very important.\n\n2. Maintain a connection between yourself and your dog while out on walks. Dogs often become environmentally ﬁxated when there is so much to see, hear, and smell. Actively maintain your bond with your dog while out on walks. You are taking a walk together.\n\nWalk from the stationary position. Use the term “Let’s Go” signaling your dog that something different is going to happen on the walk. “Let’s Go” means, “I am leaving, and you are coming with me!” Practice “Let’s Go” whenever you move from a stopped position while on walks. “Let’s Go” is the green light. It also has the effect of a turn signal before making a change in direction. If you use this phrase often, your dog learns what it means, while snifﬁng and it is time to go, when you are planning to cross the street, or when leaving another dog and continuing your journey. It is so exciting when you and your dog work as a team!\n\nUse Name Response when you want to get your dog’s attention immediately for any reason while leash-walking. Call your dog’s name while on leash. Teach your dog to look at you for further instruction, as a check-in behavior while on walks, and to redirect ﬁxation on other dogs, distractions, or stressors.",

The instant your dog makes eye contact with you, mark it with a click/treat, a “Good”/treat, or simply a treat.\n\nReward your dog generously in some way for both looking at you automatically without being asked and for looking at you when you use Name Response. Start marking and rewarding whenever your dog freely offers eye contact while walking on leash without calling your dog’s name. You can click/treat or just treat. Turning toward you when called and making eye contact without being asked are highly desirable behaviors your dog can do while leash-walking and keeping a connection with you. The goal is having your dog check in with you frequently.\n\nYou want your dog to learn that walking slowly and calmly with you is rewarding. Walking at the slow pace of a human generally must be taught to dogs. It is not natural for a healthy, young dog to walk slowly: if it were up to your dog, your dog would be zigzagging and circling everywhere you go. The slower the better to start. Do not let your dog rush you. You should decide speed, direction, “sniff-sniff” breaks, and when and where to stop, although going on walks letting your dog choose the route is one type of valuable enrichment of choice and can be fun for you too. Try it!\n\nMany interesting, complex, agility, and service dog behaviors begin using a target. The purpose of hand-targeting for leash-walking is a technique of using your hand as a target for your dog to follow. That is, teach your dog to follow and touch your open hand with the nose while you are both in the leash-walking position. The presentation of your hand is both the hand signal and the target to be touched.",

In their “Position Statement on Puppy Socialization”, the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior (AVSAB) advises, “Classes and at-home training should be based on positive reinforcement with frequent rewards, praise, petting, play and/or treats.

Address these needs using the force-free methods listed in The Hierarchy of Dog Needs. Make certain your dog is getting sufﬁcient exercise, proper nutrition, social interaction,\n\nmental stimulation, and novelty on a daily basis. If these basic needs are not met, stress increases.\n\nThe best way to prevent aggression is practicing a program of careful, frequent, and regular socialization from a young age, if possible, especially during the sensitive period of socialization, 4–12 weeks of age. In addition, prevent traumatic experiences by carefully managing socialization. Avoid ﬂooding. Assess your dog’s experience at the veterinarian and groomer as possible contributing factors to aggression. Get in-home care or be the ﬁrst appointment of the day. Bring treats. (See Chapter 9, Socialization.)\n\nStress is an underlying cause of aggression. “Stress matters,” says Diane Garrod, developer of the ﬁrst, systematic, canine stress release protocol, Stress Release For Dogs: The Canine Emotional Detox. She tells us:\n\nWhat is occurring in the dog’s body is important to understanding why releasing stress is so important. Stress can cause a dog to aggress and cause a dog to exhibit a number of other behaviors, such as licking, over-barking and hyperactivity. Stress might be looked at as the equivalent to human burn out. Hans Selye, considered by many as the father of the study of stress (Selye, 1936), said that a direct relationship exists between chronic stress and excessive wear and tear throughout the body.

This alone will help your dog and your visitors as well. Do not answer the door with your dog when your dog may be uncomfortable and does not really know how to behave. Your dog should not have the responsibility to decide which of your friends, and certainly not which dogs feel safe, and which do not.\n\nProvide your dog with high value treats such as cheese or healthy hot dogs, that you initially feed in the secure space when guests arrive. Later, if safe and practical, have your guests toss your dog treats. You must protect your guests by not giving your dog access to them, unless and until: 1. Your dog appears entirely comfortable with them. 2. You have advised and instructed your cooperative guests about\n\nNever bring a new dog into your home and just “see how it goes” (Richmond, 2004/2019). This all-too-common mistake can set up your dogs for a lifetime of squabbling or worse. Your resident dog is well established as the only child. Abruptly adding another dog or a puppy into the household as a visitor, a foster, or a newly adopted dog can easily lead to territorial aggression. Serious resource guarding between the dogs may erupt if your resident dog feels that an intruder has just invaded the home. Ideally, introduce each dog to the other’s scent and allow each dog to acclimate to the other’s scent before you house the dogs together. Follow these cardinal rules:",

Wipe a rag around dog A’s anus near the main scent glands, then wipe that same rag around dog B’s shoulders and rear. Now do the same with dog B (Wilde, 2018). This mixes their scents for recognition of familiarity. Then, switch living spaces and yard time, giving each a chance to leave scent without seeing the other dog. Later, let your new dog roam around the house and yard leaving scent. Now, allow your resident dog to do the same thing. Repeat this again and again daily until you see little to no reaction to other dog’s scent by either dog, especially your resident dog. This process may take days or weeks. Patiently using this process right from the start, while carefully observing body language, can\n\nsave yourself and your dogs, years of heartache, angst, and trouble. If you have advance notice, place the cloth in a self-sealing plastic bag and freeze to preserve the scent, then deliver to the other dog’s current residence, packed in ice.",

This technique introduces your dogs on neutral territory with a positively reinforcing activity, so your resident dog is less likely to consider your new dog a territorial intruder. A different individual must handle each dog. The technique of parallel walking includes plenty of time for snifﬁng, then gradually moving them closer together as long as both dogs are clearly under the threshold of reactivity. Now, allow the dogs to sniff each other for just a few short seconds, separate and continue the walk, with high value reinforcement being provided to each dog by the handlers.\n\nAllow the dogs to meet on neutral property, such as a friend’s yard, leash- free, or dragging their leashes with a high level of supervision and intervention, if needed. If meeting on leash, let the dogs sniff and greet each other very brieﬂy—a few short seconds, then break. Rest and then repeat until you feel conﬁdent both dogs are comfortable with each other.\n\nIf all has gone well, allow the dogs to have free access to one another as long as they continue socializing properly without incident.\n\nThere really is no such thing as a “nip.” Even an air snap is considered a “bite”, albeit the lowest on Dr. Dunbar’s Bite Scale: An assessment of the severity of bites based on evaluation of wound pathology (Dunbar, 2007–",

Aggression is not something your dog will outgrow. The longer you wait, the more difﬁcult, or perhaps impossible, modifying aggressive behavior will become. Once the momentum for aggression has begun, it is likely to snowball with an increasing risk of a person or another dog getting bit. Conversely, it is more likely to decrease or disappear if addressed promptly and competently.\n\nAggression may be categorized as either defensive or offensive, although the lines are not always clear. Many dogs will go on the offensive out of fear to protect themselves from a perceived threat. However, understanding what is driving the aggression may be helpful:\n\nDefensive fear-based aggression. The bark-lunge seeks to keep frightening people or dogs further away, called distance increasing behavior. Offensive-based aggression. The bark-lunge seeks to inﬂict injury going out of the way to attack another, called distance decreasing behavior.\n\nOn-leash aggression Off-leash aggression Territorial aggression Fence-barrier aggression Resource guarding aggression Sibling rivalry aggression, also known as multi-dog household ﬁghting\n\nWhen assessing the severity of aggression, you will need to examine the bite factors below using the resources provided:\n\nContext, that is, understand the nature of the triggering antecedent Ameliorating and exacerbating factors Predictability Warning displays, or lack of warning displays",

Remember, not all dogs care for other dogs and we should not expect them to be social butterﬂies. It is just not fair. After all, sociability in people varies widely between individuals too.\n\nAttempts to escape a situation or person, by moving away, or walking away are indications your dog is feeling threatened and is politely asking for the perceived threat to end.

Developing a treatment plan requires understanding the function of the behavior, i.e., the purpose of both the antecedents and the consequences that are driving the dog’s behavior. We ask two questions:\n\n1. What is motivating the behavior? For example, is the dog seeking to communicate a need, such as the need to eliminate or a need to escape? Is the dog seeking reinforcement such as water, food, or chew toys? Is the dog seeking attention? Is the dog seeking sensory reinforcement, such as novelty?\n\n2. What is maintaining the behavior? For example, is the dog ﬁnding the behavior reinforcing by accessing food, toys, or escape? Is the dog\n\nreceiving attention? Is the dog receiving sensory reinforcement, such as snifﬁng?\n\nThe process of conducting a functional assessment is comprised of the following steps, as explained succinctly by Niki Tudge, founder of the Pet Professional Guild (Tudge, 2015, p. 151–155.)",

Guarding stations are areas where your dog can watch for, commonly known as “lying in wait,” or anticipate people and/or dogs passing by. Eliminate guarding stations in your home and yard preventing aggression from developing and generalizing to other situations involving strangers and other dogs. All dogs are genetically hard-wired to guard the home, but some breeds are more predisposed to do so than others. Remove the opportunity for fence ﬁghting aggression with neighbor dogs by using visual barriers, double-barriers, or only allowing your dog outdoors when the neighbor dogs are not outdoors. Remove the opportunity for aggression towards neighbors when you and your dog leave or enter your home by changing your schedule, using the back door, or otherwise rearranging the environment. Assess your dog’s experience at the veterinarian and groomer as possible contributing factors to dog-dog reactivity. Get in-home mobile care or schedule the ﬁrst appointment of the day and bring treats. (See Chapter 8, Gentle Veterinary and Grooming Care, for Desensitization Protocols.) Stop feeding from a bowl and use half of your dog’s daily calorie ration for training alone. Use high value treats, such as healthy hot dogs, air-dried meat, cheese, boiled chicken, or whatever healthful food your dog values above all else.\n\nIn “Lunging, Barking, Biting, Oh My” the founder of the Canine Research Studies group, Rebekah Hudson, MPH, CVT, emphasizes the critical need for understanding thresholds and trigger stacking when using force-free methods for emotional and behavioral modiﬁcation.

D&CC is the gold standard for aggression treatment.\n\nThe desensitization and counterconditioning process occurs when your dog is exposed to a fear, aggression, or hyperactive evoking object or situation at an intensity that does not evoke a response—staying below the threshold of reactivity. The goal of successfully implementing D&CC is to no longer observe a reaction to the trigger. After establishing a threshold of no reaction, decrease the distance or increase the intensity between the dog and the person, other dog, moving object, or situation in tiny steps, as long as your dog continues to remain calm. Over time move as close to the trigger as possible as long as your dog does not react. There is never a need to provoke a response: Indeed, you seek to prevent the opportunity to react with the old behavior. Avoid harsh methods or collars that cause pain as\n\nthey may stop a behavior in the moment, but in truth they increase fear and anxiety, and may be the cause of aggression (Overall et al., 2006).",

Examples of triggers are: Other dogs, strangers, children, men, skateboards, motorcycles, or the washer and dryer in your laundry room. Examples of behaviors and vocalizations are: Staring, then barking and lunging with hackles raised.\n\nSuccessful Desensitization Depends Upon Faithful Adherence to Two Principal Rules:\n\nRule 1. Always stay below your dog’s threshold of reaction. This means your dog does not have the emotional, behavioral reactions, or body language expressions listed in the chart below.\n\nRule 2. The intensity of the trigger is increased gradually in very small increments, and only if and when your dog does not have the reactions listed in the chart. Increasing the level of intensity often means decreasing the distance between your dog and the trigger, one small step at a time, while your dog continues remaining under threshold. Progress too quickly and you will see regression with your dog’s reactions becoming worse, progress too slowly and you will see little improvement.\n\nTwo Types of Changes Occur with Desensitization and Counterconditioning\n\nClassical Counterconditioning = Conditioned Emotional Response (CER), that is a new emotional reaction\n\nOperant Counterconditioning = Response Substitution, that is, learning a new behavior\n\nUse this chart to help you identify your dog’s triggers and responses.

The Be a Tree program has special suggestions for children to learn to stay safe (Doggone Safe, 2018).",

Do not pet a dog over the head as is common in our culture. A human body leaning over and above a dog with an arm reaching over the head may easily be perceived as a threat and become a trigger to bite. Your face may be the closest and easiest place to bite. Alternatively, if a dog approaches you, if safe, calmly offer a ﬁst at your side and allow the dog to sniff the ﬁst. Then, if safe, pet the dog under the chin or on the breastplate with gentle strokes.

Do not attempt to move or stop a dog by pulling on the dog’s collar or neck. Instead, call the dog to you, or toss a piece of food. Do not pet or touch a dog while the dog is eating food, chewing on a bone, or other item of value to the dog. Do not reach to remove food, toys, or other valued objects from your dog. If it is necessary to remove an object, trade up by offering an irresistible piece of food. (See this chapter, Resource Guarding, below.)

Conﬂicts over resources such as food, territory, mating privileges, and access to others, are well documented in the animal behavior scholarly literature. Rules of appropriate social behavior in dog society are quite different than in human society. Dog-dog aggression can be a dangerous problem for you, your dog, other dogs, and anyone who tries to break up a dog ﬁght. We expect dogs to play-nice with new dogs in group situations and when out on neighborhood strolls. Reexamine your expectations and goals for your dog. Realistically, if your dog exhibits generalized dog-dog aggression, it is unlikely your dog will turn into a social butterﬂy, but with consistent training and management, you can make the world less stressful for both of you. The most common mistake pet parents and trainers make is rushing the process, causing setbacks. Your dog needs to learn to trust that you will not be walking into stressful or dangerous situations so there is no need to remain on high alert. Do not give up! Before you head off to the local dog park or dog beach there are two important questions to ask yourself: “Is it safe?” and “Is my dog really having fun?” (See Chapter 9, Dog Park Safety Tips and Chapter 3, Fair Play.)",

First, make certain both dogs’ needs are being met as outlined in the Hierarchy of Dog Needs pyramid. Spend time alone with each dog individually, so bonding occurs early in the relationship, and you are better able to manage them when they are together. Medical, nutritional, security, exercise, and emotional needs must be attended to before rivalry between your dogs is likely to show any signiﬁcant improvement. For minor incidents with dogs who have otherwise good social skills with each other, let them work out non-violent differences without your intervention. If your dogs scufﬂe a bit, give them a chance to calm down by securely separating\n\nthem. Then remove the triggers and release them to play together again supervising closely and intervening if necessary.\n\nSerious cases of sibling rivalry can be among the hardest to treat. However, steps can be taken to prevent sibling rivalry from developing from the start. If sibling rivalry is addressed early, these cases may have surprisingly good outcomes.",

Make certain your dogs have a place of sanctuary in the home where others will not intrude in case of high tension or altercations.\n\nSet Your Dogs up for Success by Avoiding These Tense Conditions\n\nFeed your dogs separately to avoid competition, food swapping, and stress during feeding. Remove all items either one of the dogs guard. Keep dogs separated by creating both physical and visual barriers such as: Baby gates, separate rooms, tethers, or rotating one dog indoors and one dog outdoors. Later, switch their locations.\n\nMake certain the dogs are getting plenty of exercise.\n\nThe ﬁrst step in diffusing sibling rivalry is identifying each of your dogs’ stressors and eliminating as many as possible.

The trainer and pet parent must always put safety ﬁrst! Treatment begins with a neutral object presented at an intensity where your dog does not display any distress or reactive behavior, including body language. Distance is closed, bit-by-bit, incrementally, over the course of treatment, as long as the dog remains under the threshold of reactivity and there are no indications of stress or reactivity. Various objects are used - slowly graduating to the typically guarded item, person, or location. In the classic trade favorite, Mine! A Practical Guide to Resource Guarding in Dogs, author, Jean Donaldson, details step-by-step meticulous hierarchical plans addressing common types of resource guarding, and the variables affecting the intensity of guarding (Donaldson, 2002.) The course of treatment may be many weeks and should be undertaken with the guidance and under the close supervision of a qualiﬁed force-free emotional and behavioral consultant who specializes in resource guarding.\n\nResource guarding between dogs is a different type of problem. Dogs are genetically hard-wired to prevent others of their species from stealing their valuable resources. The easiest and best answer is management.

    "page_content": "One rarely mentioned but very important conditioning effect of force-free training is the pairing of your hand with receiving high value food. This pairing develops trust that your hand always delivers food, but never takes food away.\n\nMake your approach to the food bowl something your dog ﬁnds not only non-threatening, but also very positive. Your approach toward the bowl means more, not less food for your dog, and higher value food.\n\nFor puppies or dogs who do not already guard bowls\n\nSit on the couch with your dog on one side and a bowl full of food on the other side. Hand-feed your puppy or dog, piece by piece, from the bowl.\n\nStart with the empty food bowl in its normal location. Begin the process of desensitization by walking over and dropping one piece of food into the empty bowl as you pass by. This is how your dog learns to trust people when they are coming near the food bowl. Then, put some low value food in the bowl, and as your dog is eating, walk by and drop a higher value bit of food into your dog’s bowl. For example, if your dog is eating kibble, walk by and drop a piece of chicken into the bowl. If safe, slowly, and carefully pair your hand reaching toward the food bowl to deliver food. Never let your dog associate your hand with taking away a valuable item or food bowl.\n\nOne of the standard preventive resource guarding best practices is to trade up with your dog if your dog is already in possession of something you need to retrieve for safety reasons, or an item that does not belong to your dog. Be certain the value of the new food or item for trade is of higher value to your dog than the item your dog is guarding—not just of higher value in your opinion!",

Alternatively, trade your dog a different tennis ball for the tennis ball you would like your dog to drop. Toss treats away from your dog and away from the item in possession, so your dog is walking in the opposite direction with the rear end (not the head) facing you while you safely remove an item that may be dangerous to your dog, such as a pill bottle.\n\nTeach your dog to drop what is in the mouth by giving the verbal cue “Drop” and then tossing treats away from your dog repeatedly in practice sessions. Very slowly, increase the value of the item you ask your dog to drop for a high value treat.\n\n“Dog Property Laws” (Anonymous) are quite different than human property laws. If you are not aware of these dog laws, take heed. Framed in comedy here, they are funny yet uncannily true.\n\nIf I like it, it’s mine. If you have something and put it down, that makes it mine.

A personal friend or force-free trainer who understands your dog’s history may be a possibility but be aware that ﬁnding someone suitable may require a great deal of dedicated effort.

Confer with your integrative practice veterinarian for the best medical care from both standard allopathic and more wholistic-oriented treatments.

Allergic reactions are immune system regulated resulting in itchy skin in some pets and vomiting and diarrhea in others.\n\nBathe your dog weekly with a gentle hypoallergenic dog shampoo, leave-in conditioners, and cool rinses.

    "page_content": "There are three known common causes of allergies—the environment, ﬂeas, and diet. Allergy to ﬂeas and allergens in the environment are much more common in dogs than food allergies, but all have similar symptoms.\n\nThe most common season for allergies is spring, or at the ﬁrst sign of winter. When exactly do the symptoms begin with your dog? Monitor the episodes. Keep a record for your reference.\n\nIn a fair number of cases there is a hereditary factor, such as a predisposition to atopic disease. Atopic Disease (AD) is analogous to hay fever in humans triggered by pollen, mold spores, dust, and dust mite droppings. Dogs may be exposed through breathing (inhaling) or through the skin. Determine whether other dogs in the litter have atopic disease triggered by environmental factors. Before the age of three, 75% of dogs with atopic disease show symptoms.\n\nThis etiology most often affects the feet, armpits, face, groin, tummy, and ears. Pay special attention to the inside the ears. Rubbing the face against furniture is often misinterpreted as an annoyance behavior rather than an attempt to relieve the discomfort of an allergy-related medical condition.\n\nPut some of these preventive and protective techniques to work during your dog’s allergy season. Whether you can speciﬁcally identify the allergen or not, limit possible exposure as much as possible. Here are some things you can do to help your dog avoid and heal from itching:",

Many dogs accept a new baby into the home without any problems; however, some do not, and some need a lot of help. This chapter is designed to help you prevent common problems and encourage you to be well-prepared to care for both dog and baby.\n\nAs responsible baby and pet parents, it is your job to protect your baby from your dog, and to protect your dog from your baby. Safety ﬁrst is the cardinal rule. Many online posts show appallingly unsafe interactions between babies, young children, and the family dog. Children are the group most frequently bitten by dogs, and most often those bites are from the family dog or a well-known dog. Take the relationship between your child and your dog very seriously. Ultra-close supervision is the responsibility of the parents, not the responsibility of the dog or the toddler. Keep your child and your dog safe and prevent harassment or teasing of your dog by your\n\nnaturally curious child. It is up to you, your child’s parent, and your dog’s pet parent, to draw clear physical boundaries and make the rules.\n\nThe relationship between your baby and your dog will change while each of them grow through their respective developmental stages. Dogs react differently to children at each stage of the dog’s development, and at each stage of the child’s development, and vice versa. Most parents see a change in the dog’s behavior when the child begins to crawl, toddle, walk, and then run.",

The pioneering psychologist, Jean Piaget, in his Construction of Reality of the Child (Piaget, 1954) described the stages of cognitive development in children exploring the process of thinking and intellectual development at each stage. Research on a child’s normal brain development indicates that it is not until approximately the age of ﬁve that a child can process the information that the dog can hurt them, and that they can hurt the dog. Ideally, parents ought to add a dog to the family after children have reached the age of ﬁve years old. This may not ﬁt your plan or situation, but keep these ideas in mind:\n\n1. Younger children simply do not have the cognitive ability to understand that a dog can bite. Toddlers cannot understand how a bite would hurt and affect their own lives, how it would affect other family members, and certainly not what it could mean for the dog’s life.\n\n2. Toddlers cannot understand that they can hurt and/or frighten a dog.

Assess your dog’s behavior toward infants, toddlers, strangers, and reactions to novel items, smells, and situations. Does your dog have small-animal predatory tendencies, resource-guarding behaviors, startle phobia, or fear responses? If so, call a professional for an assessment and treatment. Do not play aggressive games with your dog. Management. Create a safe sanctuary that is, a Doggy Enrichment Land dog zone for your dog. Separately, create a safe sanctuary baby zone and enriched environment for your child. For older children, put painter’s tape around the dog’s bed or crate to draw the boundary line. Ask the children not to cross that line. It is amazing how kids follow rules, and how they often they are willing to “correct” their siblings and their parents if a parent break the rules!\n\nEnclosed gated areas keep the dog and your defenseless baby separated and safe, so both you and your dog can relax. Your dog needs a safe place to relax away from your child as well. Always keep your dog either with you or in a secured dog zone. Use a playpen to contain toddlers and allow your dog to roam free, if safe.",

Acclimate your dog to the incoming new baby sounds, gadgets, smells, and various baby routines by role- playing activities such as diaper changing, and stroller walks with a doll before you bring your baby home. Everything associated with the baby should become the new normal routines, as opposed to sudden or anxiety-provoking novel experiences. Check out “Baby Sounds for Pets, Dogs, Cats and Other Animals”, a recording of crying, grunting, bathing, happy squealing, snoring, and giggling baby sounds from Dr. Lewis Kirkham (2014). Socialization. After taking the desensitization steps above, and under close and careful supervision invite close friends with infants to visit. This will slowly and safely acclimate your dog to the presence of babies in the home. Take your people-friendly dog to observe children at play from a distance. Reward your dog with treats and soft praise for remaining calm while in the presence of small children. Your dog will develop positive associations with babies. Training basic manners and skills. Address training and behavior issues before the baby arrives. Practice using voice instructions with your dog to keep your hands free to care for your baby. Train-out the\n\nbehaviors you do not want. You do not need to teach your dog a great many behaviors. Numerous instructions may be confusing to your dog. Focus on training both basic manners and impulse management in a distraction-free environment for optimal results. Your dog should know the following behaviors reliably well A. Name Response B. Sit C. Down D. Wait/Stay E. Come F. Calm Leash-walking",

Hire a force-free dog walker if your dog needs more exercise, fun, or socializing more than you can now comfortably provide.\n\nIntroduce Your Dog to Your Baby Slowly and Gradually\n\nHelp your dog experience the arrival of the baby as a good thing. Share your attention with the dog when the baby is present. This will endear your baby to your dog and prevent “sibling” rivalry. Make the arrival of the baby to your home a neutral event. When coming home from the hospital, have a parent come into the house alone and calmly greet the dog ﬁrst. Then put your dog on leash and ask for a “Sit” or a “Down.” Have a parent come into the home with the baby and either retreat to another room and save introductions for later, or if your dog looks relaxed, walk your dog calmly and slowly toward the baby and let your dog sniff your baby’s toes—not your baby’s face. Ideally, your dog will not be overly interested in the baby\n\nin the future, and will treat your baby with relative indifference, which is best at this stage. You don’t want your baby to be intently or primarily interested in the dog either. Do not encourage your baby’s ﬁxation on the dog but redirect attention away from the dog for the most part.",

Most frightened dogs will run away\n\nor hide if possible. Some have an active defense reﬂex and attempt to attack what frightens them.

SA is a stress-related disorder, more speciﬁcally, a fear reaction to being left alone. It is deﬁned by emotional and physical distress brought on by the absence of an attachment ﬁgure. When left alone, dogs suffering with SA disorder experience what is akin to a panic attack in humans.\n\nResearch in the ﬁeld of developmental psychology has shown that SA in dogs may be similar to an attachment disorder in humans. Separation anxiety indicates there is an insecure anxiety-driven attachment most often to a pet parent, or possibly to a canine housemate (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). Some dogs are comforted with another person as a substitute for the primary relationship, but many are not.

If a dog does have SA, pet parents may want to reconsider their sleeping arrangements in a kind and step-wise manner. There is evidence that allowing dogs to sleep in bed contributes to SA or other behavior problems. According to attachment theory, co-sleeping practices may exacerbate SA when the attachment ﬁgure is away from the home (Thompson & Smith, 2014). Jagoe and Serpell (1996) found that dogs who sleep in bed with pet parents may respond adversely to separation and display the separation-related problems of urination and defecation, having developed an “unbalanced” attachment to that person.

CC is a form of behavior modiﬁcation used to induce a behavior that is incompatible with an undesirable behavior such as the symptoms seen in SA. CC was central to the development of systematic desensitization, a treatment for phobias in which the patient is taught relaxation techniques and exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli. The goals of CC and SD are reducing the dog’s dependence on the pet parent in a stepwise and planned manner. Sargisson notes that some studies indicate the power of SD is greater when combined with CC than when either is used alone.\n\nAn in-depth systematic review of counterconditioning (Keller et al., 2020) examined the effectiveness of counterconditioning at preventing relapse when compared with extinction, which is nonreinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior. A negative emotional experience (in this case anxiety) is replaced with a positive emotional experience (such as eating food) using appetitive counterconditioning (AC). A number of animal studies included in the review demonstrate that counterconditioning is more effective at reducing fear than mere exposure to the stimuli. Relapse to the original negative association is more likely to occur with extinction than with counterconditioning. The review also reveals that earning the reward—such as with an interactive food toy, or Grazing Games scavenging —may lead to even better outcomes than desensitization exposure alone.

Most, but not all, independently validated research continues to point in this direction.\n\nWolpe (Wolpe, 1954a) suggests that facing one’s fears does not always resolve them but the key to overcoming fear is accomplished “by degrees.” This is especially true for dogs whose cognitive development is comparable to that of a 2- to 3-year-old child. We give a bottle to a baby who cries. Even if the baby is not hungry, the act of suckling may bring about relaxation (the ﬁrst step in DS). Similarly, giving a dog an interactive food toy or a safe bone may have the same pacifying effect. One problem is that the absence of the reward may lead to frustration and result in a return to the maladaptive behavior.\n\nCounterconditioning involves providing a stimulus of the opposite valence, meaning one that’s seen as being “good” as opposed to “bad.” Food provides a positive valence that offsets the negative valence of being left alone.

Track What You Typically Do Before Leaving the Home\n\nYour dog has learned that a sequence of activities predict that you are preparing to leave the house. Observe your dog closely and list the possible triggers setting your dog’s stress reaction in motion. Some examples of triggers are",

The goal is to decrease the emotional gap between your presence and your absence. Make your arrival home less emotionally ﬁlled with glee and make your departure less emotionally ﬁlled with regret. Get your dog off the adrenaline roller-coaster and refrain from immediate enthusiastic greetings and sad goodbyes. This is often difﬁcult for pet parents; however, try to keep your dog’s best long-term interest in mind as your priority.\n\nMake your arrivals home somewhat boring. Try delivering your most enthusiastic greeting after your dog has calmed down. Your dog is thrilled that you are home. Do not add kindling to an already raging emotional ﬁre. For example, when you arrive home, get into the habit of smiling, saying “Hi” with a short pet, then check your email while your dog calms down. Make your departures from home calmly upbeat. If you are sad as you leave home, your dog will not understand why you are sad but will get the message that “Something’s wrong with Mommy,” from the tone of your voice. It may serve to trigger or increase the panic already set in motion. Alternatively, use an upbeat tone of voice when you leave home.\n\nIf you continue to have difﬁculty or if your dog still has more than one of the symptoms of separation anxiety, work with a force-free behavioral\n\nconsultant or consider consulting with an integrative veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist.",

They underlie all learning-teaching situations as surely as the law of gravity underlies the falling of an apple. Whenever we attempt to change behavior, in ourselves or in others, we are using these laws, whether we know it or not.\n\nUsually we are using them inappropriately. We threaten, we argue, we coerce, we deprive. We pounce on others when things go wrong and pass up the chance to praise them when things go right. We are harsh and impatient with our children, with each other, with ourselves even; and we feel guilty over that harshness. We know that with better methods we could accomplish our ends faster, and without causing distress, but we can't conceive of those methods. We are just not attuned to the ways in which modern trainers take advantage of the laws of positive reinforcement.\n\nWhatever the training task, whether keeping a four-year-old quiet in public, housebreaking a puppy, coaching a team, or memorizing a poem, it will go faster, and better, and be more fun, if you know how to use positive reinforcement.\n\nThe laws of reinforcement are simple; you can put the whole business on\n\na blackboard in ten minutes and learn it in an hour. Applying these laws is more of a challenge; training by reinforcement is like a game, one dependent upon quick thinking.\n\nAnyone can be a trainer; some people are good at it from the very start.

We are angry if children or employees break things, steal, arrive late, speak rudely, and so on, because they should know better. We punish, often long after the behavior occurred - sending people to prison being a prime example - thus creating an event that may have no effect on future behavior, and which in fact is merely retribution. Nevertheless we think of such punishment as education, and people easily refer to it in that way: \"I taught him a lesson.\"\n\nModern reinforcement training is based not on these folk beliefs but on behavioral science. Scientiﬁcally speaking, reinforcement is an event that (a) occurs during or upon completion of a behavior; and (b) increases the likelihood of that behavior occurring in the future. The key elements here are two: the two events are connected in real time - the behavior engenders the reinforcement - and then the behavior occurs more frequently.\n\nReinforcers may be positive, something the learner might like and want\n\nmore of, such as a smile or a pat, or they might be negative, something to avoid, such as a yank on a leash or a frown. What's critical is that there is a temporal relationship between them - the behavior occurs, then the reinforcer occurs, and subsequently the behavior that brought the good result or averted the bad occurs more often. In fact, the deﬁnition works in both directions, like a feedback loop: If the behavior does not increase, then either the reinforcer was presented too early or too late, or the payoff you selected was not reinforcing to that individual.",

Training is a loop, a two-way communication in which an event at one end of the loop changes events at the other, exactly like a cybernetic feedback system; yet many psychologists treat their work as something they do to a subject, not with the subject. To a real trainer, the idiosyncratic and unexpected responses any subject can give are the most interesting and potentially the most fruitful events in the training process; yet almost all experimental work is designed to ignore or minimize individualistic responses. Devising methods for what Skinner named shaping, the progressive changing of behavior, and carrying out those methods, is a creative process. Yet the psychological literature abounds with shaping programs that are so unimaginative, not to say ham- handed, that they constitute in my opinion cruel and unusual punishment. Take, for example, in one recent journal, a treatment for bed-wetting that involved not only putting \"wetness\" sensors in the child's bed but having the therapist spend the night with the child! The authors had the grace to say apologetically that it was rather expensive for the family. How about the expense to the child's psyche?

If, on the other hand, you are always delighted when your loved ones do call, so that the behavior is positively reinforced, the likelihood is that the incidence of their calling will probably increase. (Of course, if you apply negative reinforcement - \"Why haven't you called, why do I have to call you, you never call me,\" and so on, remarks likely to annoy - you are setting up a situation in which the caller avoids such annoyance by not calling you; in fact, you are training them not to call.)\n\nSimply offering positive reinforcement for a behavior is the most rudimentary part of reinforcement training. In the scientiﬁc literature, you can ﬁnd psychologists saying, \"Behavioral methods were used,\" or, \"The problem was solved by a behavioral approach.\" All this means, usually, is that they switched to positive reinforcement from whatever other method they were using. It doesn't imply that they used the whole bag of tricks described in this book; they may not even be aware of them.",

At a Shakespeare study group I once belonged to I met a Wall Street lawyer in his late forties\n\nwho was an avid squash player.

I'm whipping people I could hardly take a point from before. And I'm having more fun. Since I'm not yelling at myself all the time, I don't ﬁnish a game feeling angry and disappointed.

Rain is a positive reinforcer to ducks, a negative reinforcer to cats, and a matter of indifference, at least in mild weather, to cows. Food is not a positive reinforcer if you're full. Smiles and praise may be useless as reinforcers if the subject is trying to get you mad. In order to be reinforcing, the item chosen must be something the subject wants.\n\nIt is useful to have a variety of reinforcers for any training situation. At\n\nthe Sea World oceanariums, killer whales are given many reinforcers, including ﬁsh (their food), stroking and scratching on different parts of the body, social attention, toys, and so on. Whole shows are run in which the animals never know which behavior will be reinforced next or what the reinforcer will be; the \"surprises\" are so interesting for the animals that the shows can be run almost entirely without the standard ﬁsh reinforcers; the animals get their food at the end of the day. The necessity of switching constantly from one reinforcer to another is challenging and interesting for the trainers, too.\n\nPositive reinforcement is good for human relationships. It is the basis of\n\nthe art of giving presents: guessing at something that will be deﬁnitely reinforcing (guessing right is reinforcing for the giver, too). In our culture, present giving is often left to women. I even know of one family in which the mother buys all the Christmas presents to and from everyone. It causes amusement on Christmas morning, brothers and sisters saying, \"Let's see, this is from Anne to Billy,\" when everyone knows Anne had nothing to do with it. But it does not sharpen the children's skills at selecting ways to reinforce other people.",

Once, for example, when they were quite young, seven and ﬁve, I took them to a rather fancy store and had them select two dresses, one each, for their even younger sister. They enjoyed lolling about in the plush chairs, approving or disapproving of each dress as she modeled it. Their little sister enjoyed it too; and she had the ultimate veto power. And so, thanks to this and similar exercises, they all learned how to take a real interest in what other people want; how to enjoy ﬁnding effective positive reinforcers for the people you love.\n\nA reinforcer is something that increases a behavior; but it doesn't have to\n\nbe something the learner wants. Avoiding something you dislike can be reinforcing, too. Laboratory research shows that behavior can be increased by aversive stimuli if a change in behavior will make the aversive stimulus go away. Such stimuli are called negative reinforcers: things a person or animal will work to avoid.\n\nNegative reinforcers may consist of the mildest of aversive stimuli - a derisive glance from a friend when you make a poor joke, or a slight draft from an air conditioner that causes you to get up and move to another chair. However, even very extreme aversives, from public humiliation to electric shock, may function as negative reinforcers as well as being punishing experiences.

Suppose that while sitting in my aunt's living room, I happen to put my feet on the coffee table as I would at home. My aunt raises a disapproving eyebrow. I put my feet on the ﬂoor again. Her face relaxes. I feel relieved.\n\nThe raised eyebrow was an aversive stimulus acting as a negative reinforcer.

The lion backs onto a pedestal and stays there, to avoid the intrusive whip or chair held near its face.\n\nNegative reinforcement, however, is not the same as punishment. So\n\nwhat is the difference? In the ﬁrst edition of this book I wrote that punishment is an aversive stimulus that occurs after the behavior it was meant to modify, and therefore it can have no effect on the behavior. \"A boy being spanked for a bad report card may or may not get better report cards in the future, but he surely can't change the one he has just brought home.\" Indeed, when we punish with intent, we frequently do it far too late, but that is not the actual difference between punishment and negative reinforcement.",

Skinner was more precise. He deﬁned punishment as what happens when a behavior results in the loss of something desirable - the pleasure of investigating if this object can ﬁt into that hole, a popular pastime with babies - or when the behavior results in the delivery of something undesirable. However, in both cases, while the ongoing behavior stops, there is no predictable outcome in the future. We know that reinforcers strengthen behavior in the future, but a punisher will not result in predictable changes.\n\nFor example, will grabbing the baby or smacking his hand, even if his mother's timing is perfect, guarantee that the baby won't try sticking things into outlets again? I doubt it. Ask any parent. What really happens is that we pick up small objects, we put covers over the wall outlets, or we move furniture in front of them, and eventually the baby outgrows this particular urge.\n\nThe behavior analysts look at it this way.

Negative reinforcers can be used effectively to train behavior, and even though aversive stimuli are involved, the process can be relatively benign.

Unless handled a lot when young,\n\nthey can be hard to approach. So, while operant conditioning with a food reinforcer works splendidly with llamas, if a llama is too skittish to come close enough to a person to take the food, here's what modern llama trainers do. They use a clicker as a signal to tell the llama that what it is doing has earned a reinforcer, but the primary or real reinforcer is the removal of a negative reinforcer, an aversive.\n\nIn effect, you say to the llama, \"Will you stand still if I approach within\n\nthirty feet? Yes? Good. I'll click my clicker and turn and go farther away.\n\n\"Now will you stand still if I approach within twenty-ﬁve feet? Yes?\n\nUsing the click to mark the behavior of standing still, with the scary person turning and going away again as the reinforcer, one can sometimes\n\nget within touching distance in ﬁve or ten minutes. The llama, as it were, is in control. As long as it stands still, it can make you go away!

Click and here's some delicious food.\" And the llama is on its way to earning positive reinforcers, including food and scratching and petting, with its splendid new behavior of standing still instead of heading for the next county.\n\nThis use of retreat, or easing back when the desired behavior occurs, is an important aspect of most of the so-called \"horse whisperer\" techniques. In most of these methods the trainer works with a loose horse in a conﬁned area and proceeds in a relatively short time to transform a horse in ﬂight to a horse calmly accepting a human. The horse, once perhaps completely wild, becomes so calm, even accepting a saddle and rider, that the total effect is magical.\n\nTrainers who use these techniques often have superstitious explanations\n\nfor what is happening; and while many have formed the habit of making some sound or motion that functions as the marker signal or the conditioned reinforcer, few are consciously aware of doing so. Nevertheless, it is not magic at work; it is the laws of operant conditioning.\n\nWhile negative reinforcement is a useful process, it's important to remember that each instance of negative reinforcement also contains a punisher. When you pull on the left rein, until the moment that the horse turns, you are punishing going straight ahead. Overuse of negative reinforcers and other aversives can lead to what Murray Sidman, Ph.D., calls \"fallout,\" the undesirable side effects of punishment (see Chapter 4).",

One of the keepers in my training class complained that her training of the panda had been proceeding too slowly. I thought this odd because intuitively I felt that pandas - big, greedy, active animals - should be easy to train with a reinforcer of food. I watched a session and found that while the keeper was gradually succeeding in shaping a body movement, she was giving the panda a whole carrot for each reinforcement. The panda took its own sweet time eating each carrot, so that in ﬁfteen minutes of valuable keeper time it had earned only three reinforcers (and was incidentally getting tired of carrots). A single slice of carrot per reinforcement would have been better.\n\nIn general, a reinforcer that constitutes one small mouthful for that animal is enough to keep it interested - a grain or two of corn for a chicken, a quarter-inch cube of meat for a cat, half an apple for an elephant. With an especially preferred food you can go even smaller - a teaspoon of grain for a horse, for example.

At Sea Life Park we were doing some U.S. Navy- funded research that involved reinforcing a dolphin for new responses, instead of old, previously trained behaviors. Our subject was a docile animal named Hou that rarely offered new responses. When she failed to get reinforced for what she did offer, she became inactive, and ﬁnally in one session she went twenty minutes offering no responses at all. The trainer ﬁnally tossed her two ﬁsh \"for nothing.\" Visibly startled by this largesse, Hou became active again and soon made a movement that could be reinforced, leading to real progress in the next few sessions.\n\nI had the same experience as that dolphin myself once. When I was ﬁfteen, my greatest pleasure in life was riding lessons. The stables where I rode sold tickets, ten lessons on a ticket. From my allowance I could afford one ticket a month. I was living with my father, Philip Wylie, and my\n\nstepmother, Ricky, at the time; and although they were very good to me, I had entered one of those adolescent periods in which one practices being as truculent and disagreeable as possible for days on end. One evening the Wylies, being loving and ingenious parents, told me that they were pretty tired of my behavior, and that what they had decided to do was reward me.\n\nThey then presented me with a brand-new, extra, free riding ticket. One\n\nof them had taken the trouble of going to the stables to buy it. Wow! An undeserved jackpot. As I recall, I shaped up on the spot, and Ricky Wylie conﬁrmed that memory as I was writing this book many years later.",

I do know that the extra riding ticket instantly relieved in me some strong feelings of oppression and resentment, and I suspect that's exactly how that dolphin felt, too.\n\nIt often happens, especially when training with food reinforcers, that there is absolutely no way you can get the reinforcer to the subject during the instant it is performing the behavior you wish to encourage. If I am training a dolphin to jump, I cannot possibly get a ﬁsh to it while it is in midair. If each jump is followed by a thrown ﬁsh with an unavoidable delay, eventually the animal will make the connection between jumping and eating and will jump more often. However, it has no way of knowing which aspect of the jump I liked. Was it the height? The arch? Perhaps the splashing reentry? Thus it would take many repetitions to identify to the animal the exact sort of jump I had in mind. To get around this problem, we use conditioned reinforcers.\n\nA conditioned reinforcer is some initially meaningless signal - a sound, a\n\nlight, a motion - that is deliberately presented before or during the delivery of a reinforcer. Dolphin trainers have come to rely on the police whistle as a conditioned reinforcer; it is easily heard, even underwater, and it leaves one's hands free for signaling and ﬁsh throwing.

We like to hear the phone ring or see a full mailbox, even if half our calls are no fun or most of our mail is junk mail, because we have had numerous occasions to learn to relate the ringing or the envelopes to good things. We like Christmas music and hate the smell of dentists' ofﬁces. We keep things around us - pictures, dishes, trophies - not because they are beautiful or useful but because they remind us of times when we were happy or of people we love. They are conditioned reinforcers.\n\nPractical animal training that uses positive reinforcement should almost always begin with the establishment of a conditioned reinforcer. Before the start of any real training of behavior, while the subject is doing nothing in particular, you teach it to understand the signiﬁcance of the conditioned reinforcer by pairing it with food, petting, or other real reinforcers. You can tell, incidentally, at least with animals, when the subject has come to recognize your signal for \"Good!\" It visibly startles on perceiving the conditioned reinforcer and begins seeking the real reinforcer. With the establishment of a conditioned reinforcer, you have a real way of communicating exactly what you like in the animal's behavior. So you do not need to be Dr. Dolittle to talk to the animals; you can \"say\" an amazing amount with such trained reinforcement.",

People, of course, work endlessly for money, which is after all only a conditioned reinforcer, a token for the things it can buy - even, or perhaps especially, people who have already earned more money than they can actually spend, who have accordingly become addicted to the conditioned reinforcer.\n\nOne can make a conditioned reinforcer more powerful by pairing it with several primary reinforcers. The subject at that moment may not want food,\n\nsay, but if the same reinforcing sound or word has also been associated deliberately with water, or some other needs or pleasures, it retains its usefulness and then some. My cats hear \"Good girl!\" when their supper dish is put down, when they are petted, when they are let in and out, and when they do little tricks and get treats for them. Consequently, I can use \"Good girl!\" to reinforce getting off the kitchen table, without having to follow up with an actual reinforcer. Probably the reason money is so reinforcing for us is that it can be paired with practically everything. It is an extremely generalized conditioned reinforcer.\n\nOnce you have established a conditioned reinforcer, you must be careful",

The children who rode my Welsh ponies for me quickly learned to use \"Good pony!\" only when they wanted to reinforce behavior. If they just wanted to express affection, they could chat to the pony any way they liked, except in those words. One day a child who had just joined the group was seen petting a pony's face while saying \"You're a good pony.\" Three of the others rounded on her instantly: \"What are you telling him that for? He hasn't done anything!\" Similarly one can and should lavish children (and spouses, parents, lovers, and friends) with love and attention, unrelated to any particular behavior; but one should reserve praise, speciﬁcally, as a conditioned reinforcer related to something real. There are plenty of such real events deserving praise, a reinforcer that is abundantly exchanged in happy families. False or meaningless praise, however, is soon resented, even by tiny children, and loses any power to reinforce.\n\nMarine mammal trainers use conditioned reinforcers, usually the sound of a whistle, to train whales, dolphins, seals, and polar bears. The concept was ﬁrst brought to marine mammal parks and to U.S. Navy dolphin trainers in the 1960s by Keller Breland, a graduate student of B. F. Skinner. Breland called the whistle a \"bridging stimulus,\" because, in addition to informing the dolphin that it had just earned a ﬁsh, the whistle bridged the period of time between the leap in midtank - the behavior that was being reinforced - and swimming over to the side to collect one's pay.",

In the 1990s more and more animal trainers started using operant conditioning, shaping, positive reinforcement, and conditioned reinforcers, and so did the general public, with dog owners leading the way (see Chapter 6). Because the dog owners used a plastic boxed metal clicker as a conditioned reinforcer, they began calling what they were doing clicker training and themselves, clicker trainers.\n\nThe click, as it is used by clicker trainers, has several unresearched functions besides being a conditioned reinforcer and being a bridging stimulus between earning the food and getting the food. First and foremost it constitutes what Ogden Lindsley Ph.D., has called an event marker. It identiﬁes for the trainee exactly what behavior is being reinforced. But it does more than that. It puts control in the hands, paws, ﬁns, whatever, of the learner. After a while the subject no longer just repeats the behavior; the subject exhibits intention. \"Hey! I made you click! Watch me, I'm going to do it again!\" Clicker trainers speak of that shift as the moment when \"the light bulb goes on.\" This moment is extremely reinforcing for trainer and trainee alike.\n\nEllen Reese, Ph.D., pointed out to me that the conditioned reinforcer, as",

It is, however, sometimes a shock to traditional trainers: It doesn't seem natural, somehow, that the way to train a dog to hold on to a dumbbell forever is to click it for holding the dumbbell, whereupon it is permitted to drop the dumbbell instantly and eat slices of hot dog.\n\nThe philosopher Gregory Bateson, who worked at Sea Life Park for some years, maintained that operant conditioning was just a system for communicating with an alien species. Indeed, it can be. Another major value of the marker signal is that it can be used to communicate speciﬁc information. Police ofﬁcer Steve White told me of sending his German shepherd patrol dog to search for a thrown object that had landed on top of a six-foot-tall clump of bushes. The dog searched the ground fruitlessly for a long time. Then, when it happened to raise its head, Steve clicked. The\n\ndog instantly sniffed the air at head height, alerted to a whiff of the target, and began searching around the area while scenting further upward, even standing on its hind legs to do so. Thus with no further help from Steve, the dog located the object, crashed on top of the bushes, and got it.",

The click reinforced the upward snifﬁng and kept the search behavior going, since the lost object had not yet been found. In this book's ﬁrst edition I wrote of being able to use the conditioned reinforcer several times with no actual reinforcer until the end. I said this because we sometimes did it with dolphins at Sea Life Park, during long- duration behaviors or behavior chains. What I failed to realize at the time was that we in fact used two (at least two) conditioned reinforcers or marker signals: one, the whistle, meaning all of the above - \"That's right, food's coming, go get the food over there, job's done\" - and a second, a muted whistle meaning \"That's right, but the job's not over yet.\"\n\nMany of the novice clicker trainers I worked with in the 1990s were what author Morgan Spector calls \"crossover\" trainers (that is, well skilled in correction-based training, and trying to change over to shaping and positive reinforcement). I found that they were all too willing to give clicks but no treats, to the point where the signiﬁcance of the click was extinguished. It was necessary to stress \"One click, one treat\" as a general rule, in order to teach people to shape behavior efﬁciently.",

    "page_content": "However, there are many situations in real life where some interim reinforcing stimulus can be very useful, as with Steve White's patrol dog. One answer is to use a different reinforcing stimulus to tell the trainee, \"That's right, and keep going.\" Interestingly, a \"keep going\" signal does not have to be linked directly with a primary reinforcer. Just start inserting it somewhere before the terminating click, and the learner will soon recognize it as a signal leading toward an eventual reinforcer.\n\nThen you can get fancy and use it as an informative marker signal within\n\na chain, without actually stopping the chain. For example, in dog agility\n\ncompetition, dogs are sent one by one over an obstacle course, against the clock. The owner has to tell the dog which obstacle to take next, all at a dead run. I've seen a dog clear one obstacle and then be visibly confused, as if he didn't hear the cue clearly. Is it the tunnel, or the jump? The head swiveled back and forth, and the owner yelled \"Yes!\" as the dog looked toward the jump. The dog veered instantly and took the correct obstacle.\n\nAs with a terminating click, it doesn't matter what kind of stimulus was used: a clicker, a whistle, a shout, or a wave. What counts is the fact that the stimulus was not just hopeful encouragement or cheerleading, which may distract the animal or accidentally reinforce the wrong behavior, but a well- established and precisely used conditioned reinforcer.\n\nA timely conditioned positive reinforcer tells the recipient, \"What you are doing now is good and will gain you something, so do it some more.\" You can also establish a conditioned aversive, or punisher, which communicates, \"What you are doing now is not good, and something bad will happen unless you stop.\"",

First, they view correction as if it were equivalent in value to positive reinforcement, without taking into account the other effects it has on the learner (see \"Punishment,\" Chapter 4); and second, they use those reprimands and punishers without establishing a warning signal, or conditioned aversive stimulus.",

    "page_content": "The trick to making \"No!\" effective is to establish it as a conditioned negative reinforcer. For example, anyone who feels it necessary to use a choke chain on a dog should always say \"no\" as the dog does the wrong thing, and then pause before yanking on the chain, giving the dog a chance to avoid the aversive by changing its behavior. To just yank on the chain without a warning turns the yank into a simple punishment, with no predictable effect on future behavior and a potential cumulative effect on the dog's willingness to work at all. A third popular error, continuing to yank while the dog is back in position, simply punishes both behaviors.\n\nFailing to use a conditioned negative reinforcer increases the number of actual aversives that take place in correction-based training. It also slows up the learning. Conventional dog and horse trainers sometimes take far longer than reinforcement trainers - months and even years longer - to establish reliable behaviors, not just because they rely on punishment, which stops behavior rather than starting it, but also because they employ aversives without using a conditioned negative reinforcer, necessitating hundreds of repetitions before the animal sorts out what it is supposed to be doing.\n\nA special case of the conditioned aversive signal has recently become\n\npopular among dog trainers: the no-reward marker, often the word \"Wrong,\" spoken in a neutral tone. The idea is that when the dog is trying various behaviors to see what you might want, you can help him by telling him what won't work, by developing a signal that signiﬁes \"That will not be reinforced.\"",

E Skinner's deﬁnition of punishment - taking away something desirable - means that the \"Wrong\" signal is, unavoidably, a conditioned punisher, since it means that reinforcers are not available. Does it also provide information and thereby become reinforcing? In the dog training community, I am seeing special cases where the \"Wrong\" signal is useful. If your dog has a sizable repertoire of fully shaped behaviors and cues - if, in short, it is a highly sophisticated trainee - you can establish the \"Wrong\"\n\nword as a cue for variable behavior, meaning \"Save your strength, that's a blind alley, try something else.\"\n\nThis only works if the learner has already been reinforced often for variable behavior and for actively searching for new ways to make you click. Where people run into trouble with this tricky stimulus is when they use it with an inexperienced dog that doesn't understand what is wanted. In this case people tend to use the signal as if it were a choke collar: Tell the dog to sit, it doesn't sit, bam - \"Wrong.\" If the signal has indeed been established as meaning no reinforcer is available, then \"not sitting\" is punished. But that doesn't mean that sitting is now going to happen. In fact, the results are apt to be the same as with any other punisher - highly unpredictable. The dog may quit responding altogether and slink away, or give up and start looking for its own reinforcers, resulting in unsuitable behavior such as barking, pulling on the leash, snifﬁng the ground, scratching, and in general taking its attention elsewhere.",

This in turn would allow me to selectively reinforce the more vigorous jumps, thus using my variable schedule to shape improved performance. But even some professional animal trainers fail to make good use of variable schedules of positive reinforcement; it seems to be a peculiarly difﬁcult concept for many people to accept intellectually. We recognize that we don't need to go on punishing misbehavior if the misbehavior stops, but we don't see that it's not necessary or even desirable to reward correct behavior continuously. We are less sure of ourselves when aiming for disciplined response through positive reinforcement.\n\nThe power of the variable schedule is at the root of all gambling.

People like to play slot machines precisely because there's no predicting whether nothing will come out, or a little money, or a lot of money, or which time the reinforcer will come (it might be the very ﬁrst time). Why some people get addicted to gambling and others can take it or leave it is another matter, but for those who do get hooked, it's the variable schedule of reinforcement that does the hooking.",

That is how the ex-smoker who sneaks an occasional cigarette can go back to being a heavy smoker in a day.\n\nWe have all seen people who inexplicably stick with spouses or lovers who mistreat them. Customarily we think of this as happening to a woman - she falls for someone who is harsh, inconsiderate, selﬁsh, even cruel, and yet she loves him - but it happens to men, too.

If you get into a relationship with someone who is fascinating, charming, sexy, fun, and attentive, and then gradually the person becomes more disagreeable, even abusive, though still showing you the good side now and then, you will live for those increasingly rare moments when you are getting all those wonderful reinforcers: the fascinating, charming, sexy, and fun attentiveness. And paradoxically from a commonsense viewpoint, though obviously from the training viewpoint, the rarer and more unpredictable those moments become, the more powerful will be their effect as reinforcers, and the longer your basic behavior will be maintained. Furthermore, it is easy to see why someone once in this kind of relationship might seek it out again. A relationship with a normal person who is decent and friendly most of the time might seem to lack the kick of that rare, longed-for, and thus doubly intense reinforcer.\n\nLook at it from the manipulator's point of view: I can have her/him eating out of my hand, and doing whatever I want, for my comfort and convenience solely, as long as I give her/him what she/he wants ... once in a while.

(A conditioned reinforcer will do, of course.) When we play with crossword or jigsaw puzzles, we get reinforced for correct guesses because those are the only ones that \"ﬁt.\" In doing a jigsaw puzzle, if you could put several pieces in each hole, you would not get the positive reinforcer for the right choice, which is necessary feedback in most choice-trial situations.\n\nIn addition to variable schedules, one can also establish ﬁxed schedules",

The trouble with ﬁxed schedules is that the early responses in the series are never reinforced, so they tend to dwindle down to some minimal effort. With the jumping dolphin, in due course all the jumps but the last one, the one that is actually reinforced, would get smaller. This dwindling effect of ﬁxed schedules is probably a factor in many human tasks - factory assembly lines, for example. It is necessary to work for a certain length of time in order to get reinforced, but since the reinforcement is on a ﬁxed schedule, regardless of quality of performance, the subject quite naturally is motivated to do the least amount of work possible to still\n\nstay in the game and may perform especially poorly at the start of the work period. Payday on Friday is a ﬁxed reinforcement leading directly to Blue Monday. With the dolphins, occasional random reinforcements for the ﬁrst or second jump as well as the sixth will help maintain behavior.

It was always a huge temptation, as ﬁve o'clock rolled around, not to go. But then I found that if I broke down the journey, the ﬁrst part of the task, into ﬁve steps - walking to the subway, catching the train, changing to the next train, getting the bus to the university, and ﬁnally, climbing the stairs to the classroom - and reinforced each of these initial behaviors by consuming a small square of chocolate, which I like but normally never eat, at the completion of each step, I was at least able to get myself out of the house, and in a few weeks was able to get all the way to class without either the chocolate or the internal struggle.\n\nReinforcement occurs all the time in real life, often by coincidence. A\n\nbiologist studying hawks noticed that if a hawk caught a mouse under a particular bush, it would check out that bush every day for a week or so thereafter; the probability that it would ﬂy over that particular spot had been strongly reinforced.

However, accidental pairings also occur, and these can still have a strong effect on behavior. When the behavior is in fact unrelated to the consequence, but the subject still exhibits the behavior as if it were required for earning a reinforcer, scientists call it superstitious behavior. An example is pencil chewing. If, while taking an exam, you happen to put your pencil in your mouth and just then the right answer or a good idea occurs to you, the reinforcer may affect the behavior; good ideas occur during pencil chewing, so pencil chewing is reinforced. When I was in college, I didn't own a pencil that wasn't covered with teeth marks - on really tough exams I sometimes bit pencils right in\n\ntwo. I even felt sure that pencil chewing helped me to think; of course it didn't, it was just accidentally conditioned behavior.\n\nThe same goes for wearing a particular garment or going through a ritual\n\nwhen you are about to engage in a task. I have seen one baseball pitcher who goes through a nine-step chain of behavior every time he gets ready to pitch the ball: touch cap, touch ball to glove, push cap forward, wipe ear, push cap back, scuff foot, and so on. In a tight moment he may go through all nine steps twice, never varying the order. The sequence goes by quite fast - announcers never comment on it - and yet it is a very elaborate piece of superstitious behavior.",

The animal may be responding to criteria you had no intention of establishing but that were accidentally reinforced often enough to become conditioned. For example, the animal may behave as if it has to be in a particular place or facing or sitting a certain way to earn reinforcement. When you want it to work in a new place or face another way, suddenly the behavior mysteriously breaks down, and ﬁguring out why may take some doing. It is wise, therefore, once a behavior has been at least partially trained, to introduce variations in all the circumstances that do not matter to you, lest some accidental conditioning develops that might get in your way later.\n\nAbove all, watch out for the development of accidental patterns of\n\ntiming. Both animals and people have a very clear sense of time intervals. I was once quite convinced that I had trained two porpoises to jump on command (a hand signal from me) until a visiting scientist with a stopwatch informed me that they were jumping every twenty-nine seconds. Sure enough, with or without my command, they jumped every twenty-nine seconds. I had become accidentally conditioned to give the command with great regularity, and they had picked up on that instead of on the information I thought they were using.\n\nMany traditional animal trainers are absolutely riddled with superstitious\n\nthinking and behavior.

The group instantly erupted in a huge burst of applause, expressive of sympathy and understanding as well as of hearty relief - a very powerful positive reinforcer of the illumination the arguer had just received.",

Erhard, like a Zen teacher, often resorts to aphorisms; in the case of the arguer described above, the est saying is \"When you're right, that's what you get to be: right.\" That is, not necessarily loved, or anything else nice: just right. If I I were to quote that aphorism at a party when somebody is being bombastic, another est graduate might laugh - and indeed, any good modern trainer might laugh - but most hearers might assume I was moronic or drunk. Good training insights do not necessarily lend themselves to verbal explanation.\n\nOne possible application of reinforcement training is reinforcing\n\nyourself. This is something we often neglect to do, partly because it doesn't occur to us, and partly because we tend to demand a lot more of ourselves than we would of others. As a minister I know puts it, \"Few of us have such low standards that it's easy to live up to them.\" As a result we often go for days at a time without letup, going from task to task to task unnoticed and unthanked even by ourselves. Quite aside from reinforcing oneself for some habit change or new skill, a certain amount of reinforcement is desirable just for surviving daily life; deprivation of reinforcement is one factor, I think, in states of anxiety and depression.\n\nYou can reinforce yourself in healthful ways - with an hour off, a walk, a\n\ntalk with friends, or a good book; or in unhealthful ways - with cigarettes, whiskey, fattening food, drugs, late nights, and so on.

How do you get a dog to turn back ﬂips or a dolphin to jump through a hoop?\n\nDogs ﬂipping, dolphins jumping through hoops, or people throwing\n\nbasketballs through hoops, for that matter, are developed by shaping.

Whatever a creature does, it will do it with more vigor at some times than at others, in different directions, and so on. No matter how elaborate or difﬁcult the ultimate behavior you wish to shape, you can always, by establishing a series of intermediate goals, ﬁnd some behavior presently occurring to use as a ﬁrst step. For example, suppose I decided to train a chicken to \"dance.\" I might begin by watching the chicken moving around as chickens do and reinforcing it every time it happened to move to the left. Soon my ﬁrst goal would be reached: the chicken would be moving to the left quite often - and, being variable, sometimes a little and sometimes a lot. Now I might selectively reinforce only the stronger movements to the left - turning a quarter circle, say. When these responses predominated, natural variability would again ensure that while some turns were less than a quarter circle, some would be more like half a circle. I could raise my criteria, set a new goal, and start selecting for half-circle turns or better. With the chicken shaped to make several full turns at high speed per\n\nreinforcement, I might consider that I'd reached my end goal, a dancing chicken.\n\nWe are all quite accustomed to shaping and being shaped. In an informal way much of childrearing is a shaping process. The training of any physical skill, from tennis to typing, consists largely of shaping. We are also shaping when we try to change our own behavior - to quit smoking, say or to be less shy, or to handle money better.",

Most of us can acquire at least some proﬁciency at almost anything, if we just put enough time into it.\n\nBut that's boring. Don't we always want to learn new skills - skiing, piano playing, whatever - as fast as possible? Of course we do, and that's where good shaping comes in. Further, don't we prefer to avoid or minimize repetition? Yes again. Of course, some physical skills require repetition, because muscles \"learn\" slowly and must be put through the motions repeatedly before the motions come easily. Even so, a well-planned shaping program can minimize the required drilling and can make every moment of practice count, thus speeding up progress tremendously. And ﬁnally, in sports, music, and other creative endeavors, you may want to develop not only reliable performance but as good a performance as you or the one you're training can possibly give. In that case, correct use of the laws governing shaping may be crucial.\n\nThere are two aspects to shaping: the methods - that is, the behaviors that are to be developed and the sequence of steps used to develop them - and the principles, or rules governing how, when, and why those behaviors are reinforced.",

If you are interested in learning a particular skill, I would strongly urge that you ﬁnd out as much as possible about the established methods of accomplishing the behaviors' that that skill involves, through books, teachers, or coaches and through watching or studying others.\n\nOn the other side of shaping, however, are the principles, the rules that control such matters as when to press on and when to let up; how to escalate your criteria most efﬁciently; what to do when you run into trouble; above all, perhaps, when to quit. These questions are generally left to the intuition and experience of trainers or coaches, or to chance or luck.

Train one aspect of any particular behavior at a time; don't try to shape for two criteria simultaneously.\n\n3. During shaping, put the current level of response onto a variable schedule of reinforcement before adding or raising the criteria.\n\n4. When introducing a new criterion, or aspect of the behavioral skill, temporarily relax the old ones.\n\n5. Stay ahead of your subject: Plan your shaping program completely so that if the subject makes sudden progress, you are aware of what to reinforce next.\n\n6. Don't change trainers in midstream; you can have several trainers per trainee, but stick to one shaper per behavior.\n\n7. If one shaping procedure is not eliciting progress, ﬁnd another; there are as many ways to get behavior as there are trainers to think them up.\n\n8. Don't interrupt a training session gratuitously; that constitutes a punishment.\n\n9.

If your horse clears two-foot jumps, sometimes with a foot to spare, you could start raising some jumps to two and a half feet. Raising them all to three feet would be asking for trouble: The animal is capable of this but is not offering it regularly yet. And raising the jumps to three and a half feet would be courting disaster.\n\nHow fast you raise the criteria is not a function of the subject's actual ability, now or in the future; never mind if the horse is a big leggy creature potentially capable of jumping eight feet, or if it habitually hops over four- foot pasture fences. How fast you can raise the criteria is a function of how\n\nwell you are communicating through your shaping procedure what your rules are for gaining reinforcement.\n\nEvery time you raise a criterion, you are changing the rules. The subject\n\nhas to be given the opportunity to discover that though the rules have changed, reinforcers can easily continue to be earned by an increase in exertion (and also, in some cases, that performing at the old level no longer works).

The behavior may break down. A jumper might learn bad habits, such as balking or knocking down jumps, habits that will be very time-consuming to eliminate. The fastest way to shape behavior - sometimes the only way - is to raise the criteria at whatever interval it takes to make it easy for the subject to improve steadily. Constant progress, even if only inch by inch, will get you to your ultimate goal much faster than trying to force rapid progress at the risk of losing good performance altogether.\n\nI once saw a father make a serious error in this regard. Because his teenage son was doing very badly in school, he conﬁscated the youth's beloved motorcycle until his grades improved. The boy did work harder, and his grades did improve, from Fs and Ds to Ds and Cs. Instead of reinforcing this progress, however, the father said that the grades had not improved enough and continued to withhold bike privileges. This escalation of the criteria was too big a jump; the boy stopped working altogether. He furthermore became very mistrustful.\n\n2. Train one aspect of any particular behavior at a time; don't try to shape for two criteria simultaneously.\n\nI don't mean that you can't be working on many different behaviors over the same period of time. Of course you can. In any sort of lesson we might work on form for a while and then on speed - in tennis, on the backhand, then the forehand, then on footwork, and so on. It relieves monotony.

One reinforcement cannot convey two pieces of information: I should shape for size of splash until satisﬁed with that and then shape for direction of splash, whatever the size, until that, too, is learned; only when both criteria are established could I require both to be obeyed.\n\nRule 2 has a lot of practical applications.

Putting a golf ball depends on sending it the right\n\ndistance - not short of the cup and not past it or over it - and sending it in the right direction, not to one side of the cup or the other. If I were going to teach myself to putt, I would practice these separately. Perhaps I would put a piece of tape on the grass, several feet long, and practice hitting the ball just across the tape ﬁrst from two feet, then four, six, and ten feet, and so on. I might also make a circle of tape, and practice aiming at it from a ﬁxed distance, gradually reducing the circle's size, until I could hit a very small target reliably. Only when I was satisﬁed with my skills for both distance and direction would I combine them, setting up a large target size and varying the distance, then reducing the target size and varying the distance again until I could hit a small target at many distances.

For example, once a pattern of chore sharing has been established, your roommate or spouse may stop at the dry cleaners on the way home without being reinforced each time; but you might express thanks for an extra trip made when you are ill or the weather is bad.\n\nWhen we train with aversives, however - and that's the way most of us\n\nbegan - we are usually taught that it is vital to correct every mistake or misbehavior. When errors are not corrected, the behavior breaks down. Many dogs are well behaved on the leash, when they might get jerked, but they are highly unreliable as soon as they are off leash and out of reach. When out with their friends, many teenagers do things that they wouldn't dream of doing in their parents' presence. This can happen because the subject is fully aware that punishment is unavailable - when the cat's away, the mice will play - but it can also happen as a side effect of training with aversives.

All behavior is variable; when you skip an expected reinforcer, the next behavior is likely to be somewhat different. Thus the skipped reinforcer enables you to select stronger or better responses. That's sometimes called a \"differential\" or \"selective\" schedule of reinforcement; you are choosing to reinforce only some kinds of responses: those that meet, say, the requirement of being faster or longer, or facing left but not right.\n\nBut to an inexperienced learner who until now has been earning reinforcers pretty predictably, skipping reinforcers can be a shock. Your puppy sits, you click and treat for the sit, the puppy sits faster and more and more gleefully - \"Look! I'm sitting! Click me!\" And now suddenly, some sits don't work! If your puppy has not learned to withstand an occasional skipped reinforcer, it may well quit in despair or go back to a weaker or slower response. While this step is not mentioned in the learning textbooks, in practice it is useful, if you are working with a new and inexperienced learner, to deliberately teach your trainee to tolerate small variations in the reinforcement schedule, before you begin to select for bigger or better responses. Your subject has to be able to tolerate an occasional failure per se, without stopping the behavior altogether. Or, technically speaking, you need to establish an intermittent schedule of reinforcement before starting to hold out for improved performance through a differential schedule of reinforcement.",

Learning to tolerate an intermittent schedule makes the behavior - and other subsequent behaviors - more resistant to extinction.\n\nThere's another beneﬁt to this brief use of an intermittent schedule\n\nduring the learning phase. When your subject is able to tolerate the occasional skipped reinforcer, and you let a previously adequate response go by without a reinforcer, the learner is likely not only to repeat the behavior but to repeat it with more vigor: \"Hey! I did it, didn't you see me?\n\nLook! I'm doing it again!\" This intensiﬁed behavior - called an extinction burst - enables you to move more rapidly toward your goal behavior. A skilled shaper may even omit reinforcers speciﬁcally in order to provoke a varied or more vigorous response. Dog behaviorist Gary Wilkes calls this \"surﬁng the extinction bursts.\"\n\nOnce the subject has learned that a skipped reinforcer does not mean the\n\nbehavior was wrong but simply that one might need to try again, the shaping ﬂows from continuous reinforcement (as a new behavior surfaces) to differential reinforcement (as we select for better form, longer duration, faster speed, shorter latencies, and so on) and then back to continuous reinforcement (whenever the behavior is \"perfect\" or, in laboratory terms, \"meets criteria\").

By the end of the rehearsal, the musical learning reappeared, without coaching. Dolphin trainers call this the \"new tank syndrome.\" When you move a dolphin to a new tank, you have to expect that it will \"forget\" all it knows until the new stimuli are assimilated. It is important to realize that berating yourself or others for mistakes in past-learned behavior under new circumstances is bad training. The mistakes will usually clear up by themselves shortly, but reprimands cause upset and sometimes tend to draw attention to the mistakes so they don't go away.\n\nPlan your shaping program so-that if your subject makes a sudden leap\n\nforward, you will know what to reinforce next. I once spent two days shaping a newly captured dolphin to jump over a bar a few inches above the water surface. When the behavior was well established, I raised the bar another few inches; the animal jumped immediately, and so easily that I shortly raised the bar again and by a bigger increment; in ﬁfteen minutes this novice animal was jumping eight feet.\n\nA shaping \"breakthrough\" of this sort can happen at any time.

If you as trainer are going from A to B, and the subject suddenly does B perfectly in two reinforcements, you'd better have in mind steps C and D, or you will have nothing further to reinforce.\n\nBreakthroughs often seem to be extremely exciting for the subject; even\n\nanimals appear to enjoy a kind of \"Aha!\" experience and often rush about evincing elation. A breakthrough is thus a golden opportunity to make a lot of progress in a hurry. To be unprepared and to hold the subject at a low level of performance just because you don't know what to do next is at best a waste of time and at worst may discourage or disgust your subject so that it becomes less willing to work in the future.\n\nExcept under the very best of circumstances, our whole school system seems to be set up to prevent children from learning at their own rate - to penalize not only the slow learners, who don't get the time to learn, but the fast learners, who don't get additional reinforcement when quick thinking moves them ahead. If you understand in a ﬂash what your math teacher is talking about, your reward may be to writhe in boredom for hours, even weeks, while everyone else learns by inches.

If little or no learning is occurring, you have nothing to lose by switching.\n\n7. If one shaping procedure is not eliciting progress, try another.\n\nNo matter what the behavior, there are as many ways to shape it as there are trainers to think them up. In teaching children to swim, for example, one wants to get them to be fearless and comfortable about going underwater. As a ﬁrst step in this shaping task, one teacher may get them blowing bubbles in the water; another may have them put their faces in quickly and out again; a third may get them bobbing up and down until they dare to bob underneath. Any good teacher, seeing that a child is bored by or afraid of one method, will switch to another; the same shaping methods don't work equally well on every individual.",

These traditional \"recipes\" are considered the best ways, and sometimes they are, but they are also often considered the only ways, which is one reason why circus acts tend to look so much alike.\n\nThe radio and television star Arthur Godfrey, after doing a show at Sea Life Park, invited me to visit him and his wife at their farm in Virginia to watch the horse training. Godfrey was an excellent rider and trainer himself and owned a number of performing horses. We were watching a horse being\n\ntrained to bow, or kneel on one knee, by a traditional method involving two men and a lot of ropes and whips; the horse under this method is repeatedly forced onto one knee until it learns to go down voluntarily.\n\nI said it didn't have to be done that way and asserted that I could train a horse to bow without ever touching the animal. (One possibility: Put a red spot on the wall; use food and a marker signal to shape the horse to touch its knee to the spot; then lower the spot gradually to the ﬂoor so that to touch it correctly and earn a reinforcer the horse has to kneel.) Godfrey became so angry at this impertinent suggestion - the idea! If there were another way to train a bow, he would know about it - that we had to walk him around the outside of the barn two or three times to cool him off.",

Don't interrupt a training session gratuitously; that constitutes a punishment.\n\nThis doesn't apply to the casual (though meaningful and productive) shaping one might do around the house - praising school-work, welcoming homecomers, encouraging children; a reinforcer here and there, with no formality, will do ﬁne. In a more formal situation, however - in giving a lesson, say, or in shaping behavior in an animal - the trainer should keep his or her attention on the training subject or the class until the training period is over. This is more than just good manners or good self-discipline; it is skilled training. When a subject essays to earn reinforcers, it enters into a contract, so to speak, with the trainer. If the trainer starts chatting to some bystander or leaves to answer the telephone or is merely daydreaming, the contract is broken; reinforcement is unavailable through no fault of the trainee. This does more harm than just putting the trainer at risk of missing a good opportunity to reinforce. It may punish some perfectly good behavior that was going on at the time.",

If a learned behavior deteriorates, review the shaping.\n\nSometimes a skill or behavior gets rusty or seems to be totally lost. We all know how it feels to try to speak a language or remember a poem or ride a bicycle if we haven't done it in years and years: It feels most unsettling. Sometimes outside circumstances will temporarily eradicate a well-learned behavior - when stage fright, for instance, makes it impossible to give the thoroughly memorized speech, or a bad fall severely affects your rock- climbing skills. Sometimes subsequent learning overlies or contradicts the original learning, so that mix-ups occur - you strive for the Spanish word and come up with the German.\n\nSometimes the side effects of punishment or other aversive events\n\ninterfere with unrelated behavior.

Who cares why? What is needed is not justiﬁcation but an effective ﬁx.\n\nThe quickest way to correct this kind of deterioration is not to butt at it\n\nhead-on, insisting that the subject get the whole thing back before you're satisﬁed or before you reinforce, but to recall the original shaping procedure and go all the way through it very rapidly, reinforcing under the new circumstances (twenty years later, in public, in the rain, whatever) and just reinforcing once or twice at each level. At Sea Life Park we called this \"going back to kindergarten,\" and the technique often brought a poor behavior up to par in ten or ﬁfteen minutes.\n\nOf course we are doing just this whenever we review for an exam or refresh our memories by glancing at a script before going onstage. It is useful to remember that if you can more or less match the original shaping process, reviewing works equally well for physical as for mental skills. And it works with animals as well as people.\n\nHow long should a shaping session run? That depends partly on the attention span of the subject. Cats often seem to get restless after perhaps a dozen reinforcers, so ﬁve minutes might be plenty. Dogs and horses can work longer.

Accomplishing such speedy training depends, paradoxically, on your willingness to give up time limits, speciﬁc goal setting, and speed of progress itself as a goal. You must instead count simply on your willingness to quit while you're ahead. A Zen phenomenon.\n\nSometimes you can't end each training session on a high note. Perhaps the students paid for an hour and they want an hour, though a good quitting time was reached earlier. Or perhaps the session really isn't going well enough to provide a high point, but fatigue is soon going to be a problem. In that case it is wise to end the session with some easy, guaranteed way to earn a reinforcer so that the session as a whole is remembered as being reinforcing. Dolphin trainers often end long, demanding sessions with a bit of easy ball playing; riding teachers sometimes use games such as Simon Says or tag. The most inadvisable technique is to introduce new tasks or material late in the session so that it concludes with a series of inadequate and unreinforced behaviors.

The rest of the people select a trainer and choose a behavior to be shaped: for example, to write one's name on the blackboard, jump up and down, or stand on a chair. The subject is invited back in and told to move about the room and be active; the trainer reinforces, by blowing on a whistle, movements in the general direction of the desired behavior. I like to make a rule at least for the ﬁrst few reinforcements that the \"animal\" has to go back to the doorway after each reinforcer and start anew; it seems to help prevent a tendency of some subjects to just stand still wherever reinforcement was last received.

You can have patience with the animal (or the child or patient) that explodes in frustration and rage when what it had conﬁdently thought was the right thing to do turns out to be no good, a contretemps that can bring human subjects close to tears. And once you have performed nonverbal shaping with adult human subjects in an exercise, you may not be so quick to say in a teaching, coaching, or training situation in real life that the subject (animal, student, whatever) \"hates me,\" or \"is deliberately trying to get my goat,\" or \"is stupid,\" or \"must be sick today.\" It is patently obvious, during this exercise in which everyone is participating by agreement and with a will, that whatever goes wrong is a function of the training, not the trainee.",

A charm of the game purely as entertainment is that anyone can play it without previous experience. Some people have a wonderful knack for it. In my experience intuitive, creative, intensely emotional people make great shapers, and calm, observant people make great animals - just the opposite of what you might expect. Finally, one has only to look at a roomful of people intent on the shaping going on, with everyone motionless but the subject, and the trainer's whole body and mind focused on the task, to see that this is an experience akin to painting or writing: It is creative work. Except on stage, creativity is rarely shared as a group experience. The Training Game is valuable for that aspect alone.\n\nWe played some memorable rounds of the Training Game at Sea Life\n\nPark, especially one in which philosopher Gregory Bateson, being the \"animal\" for some of my dolphin trainers, proved indeed to be impossible to train, not because he stood still and thought but because he offered such an endless variety of responses that the trainer was swamped. Another to me very interesting round of this game occurred following a luncheon of six professional women, mostly unknown to each other and from widely unrelated ﬁelds.

We played the Training Game in class, and a hard core of half a dozen ﬁendishly imaginative young women began playing the Training Game at home among themselves, working in pairs usually, and shaping exotic behaviors such as crawling upstairs backward. They had been taught - successfully, in my opinion - to think analytically at the Brearley School, and they correctly did their hard thinking before and after a shaping session and ﬂung themselves into the shaping itself with the normal gusto of sixteen-year- olds. In no time they were shaping parents, using positive reinforcement on teachers, and turning obnoxious siblings into amusing companions by selectively reinforcing desired behavior. I never saw a group, before or since, grasp both the techniques and their possibilities so rapidly.\n\nShaping Shortcuts: Targeting, Mimicry, and Modeling\n\nProfessional trainers use a number of techniques to make shaping go\n\nfaster. Three that may be of use to you are targeting, mimicry, and modeling.\n\nIn targeting, which is widely used in the training of sea lions and other performing animals, you shape the animal to touch its nose to a target - a knob on the end of a pole, say, or often simply the trainer's closed ﬁst. Then, by moving the target around and getting the animal merely to go and touch it, you can elicit all kinds of other behavior, such as climbing stairs, jumping or rearing up, following the trainer, getting into and out of a",

The movement seems to attract dogs, and when they approach, we reinforce the behavior with petting. Patting the couch to invite someone to sit beside you is a form of targeting. Japanese tourist groups stick together among crowds of much taller people by following a ﬂag held above the crowd by their tour leaders - again, targeting. Flags and banners have traditionally served the same purpose in battle. Targeting has become an important tool in the new ﬁeld of reinforcement training, or \"clicker training,\" for dogs, horses, and zoo animals.\n\nMimicry comes naturally to some animals and birds, as well as to people. Young creatures of all sorts learn much of what they need to know by watching and then copying the behavior of their elders. While \"learning by observation\" is often taken by psychologists as a sign of intelligence in animals - primates being good at it and some other animals poor - I think the presence or absence of this skill in a species is a function of its ecology - that is, of its role in nature - rather than of intelligence per se. Some birds are remarkably good at behavioral mimicry. Titmice in England learned to open milk bottles on doorsteps and drink the cream, a skill that, through mimicry, spread so rapidly through the titmouse population that milk-bottle tops had to be redesigned.",

On the other hand, most cats, which get lower \"IQ scores\" than dogs from the animal psychologists, are wonderful mimickers. The folk expression \"copycat\" is no accident. If you teach a trick - ringing the doorbell to be let in, say - to one cat in the household, new or other cats may well learn it with no training from you. Cats will even copy noncats. One evening my daughter spent an hour teaching her poodle to sit on a child's rocking chair and rock it, using chopped ham as the reinforcer. One of the cats was watching. When the lesson was over, the cat, unprompted, got on the chair and rocked it most correctly looking up for its own share of chopped ham, which it most certainly had earned.",

Climbing up comes more or less automatically: It is, as biologists say, \"hard-wired.\" The claws stick out and the cat runs up the tree. To get down, however, the cat has to descend backward, so that its down-curved claws can still operate, and this appears to be a learned, or \"soft-wired,\" skill. I can testify to this because I have personally (in the middle of the night, and on top of a ladder) shaped a cat to come down a tree backward. I did so in order to spare myself the mournful yowls of a stuck cat in the future, and indeed the cat stayed shaped - it never got stuck again (though it continued to climb trees). I think in nature cats learn how to turn around and descend backward from watching their mothers as they climb trees together, but because we take them from their mothers at such a tender age - six to eight weeks - this opportunity for copycatting is lost.\n\nDolphins have a strong tendency to mimic one another, which facilitates\n\ntraining. To get several dolphins doing the same thing you shape the behavior in one, then reinforce the others for any attempt to copy. In captivity baby dolphins often learn the adults' tricks long before they themselves are old enough for ﬁsh rewards, and many oceanariums have had the experience (\"understudies,\" animals on the sidelines that watch other performing animals and prove to have learned the show behaviors without ever being reinforced for them or even doing them.) For wild dolphins, apparently, being able to imitate other dolphins must be important for survival.",

It's usually wise for the person giving the sample behavior to stand beside or turn his or her back to the subjects, so they can follow the motions with their own bodies without having to do any mental translating. The less deciphering needed, and the less verbal description used, the better the mimicry will work. Incidentally if you want to teach a right-handed skill (crocheting, say) to a left-handed person, you should sit facing him or her and have the subject mimic you, thus executing not the same-sided movements but a mirror image.\n\nOf course a major part of the shaping of the behavior of our children takes place through mimicry. What they see us do, they do too, for better or worse. In my post ofﬁce one morning recently, three little children were\n\nmaking such a ruckus, it was hard to hear anything else. Their mother, waiting in line, yelled at them several times before she succeeded in frightening them into silence. \"How do you get kids to be quiet?\" she asked the postmistress. \"Try speaking softly yourself,\" the postmistress said, quite correctly. Columnist Judith Martin (\"Miss Manners\") suggests, when teaching good manners to children, that during the training period - \"from birth to marriage\" - everybody else in the house will have to eat tidily, speak civilly, and at least feign interest in the doings and conversation of others.",

The trainer holds the young chimpanzee's hands and puts them in the desired positions or movements; eventually the ape is supposed to get the picture and make the movements spontaneously. Modeling was the secret of \"living statues,\" a circus act very popular around the turn of the century in which live people and horses were posed to resemble famous paintings or sculptures. The effect that audiences loved was the motionlessness. When the lights went up, there they all were, Napoleon's troops at Waterloo or whatever, caught as if in midmovement - not just the men but the horses, too, with necks arched, forelegs in midair, as if turned to stone. It was done, I am told, by massaging the horses for hours until they were utterly relaxed, and then modeling them like clay into the desired poses and reinforcing them for staying there.",

Until the subject is doing the behavior or at least trying to do the behavior without being held or pushed or modeled, I am not sure much learning takes place. Often all the subject learns is to let you put it through the motions: The dog, being taught to retrieve, learns to let you hold its mouth shut with the dumbbell in its jaws, but when you let go, it lets go; the toddler, put ﬁrmly into a high chair, sits quietly while you hold him or her but is up and moving the minute you take your hand away.

Sometimes this is true, but eventually can be a long time away, and to go from being pushed through a movement to doing it yourself requires insight: \"Aha! They want me to do this myself.\" This is an awful lot to ask of an animal. And even if your subject is an Einstein, repetition in the hope that enlightenment will strike is an inefﬁcient use of valuable training time. The way to make modeling work is to combine it with shaping. While you are putting the subject in position, or through the motions, you stay sensitive to the smallest effort on the subject's part to initiate the proper motion, and that effort is the behavior you reinforce. The dog's jaws tighten on the dumbbell ever so slightly, the golfer begins to swing smoothly, the little chimp's hands move of themselves, and you praise that moment. Then you can shape the new skill while \"fading\" away the modeling. The combination of modeling and shaping is often an effective way of training behavior; but it is the combination that works and not the modeling alone.",

(The trick was to get the food to the crab the instant its claw, waving about aimlessly, connected with the string; I used a long pair of dissecting forceps to put bits of shrimp right into the crab's mouthparts.) Harvard professor Richard Herrnstein told me he once shaped a scallop to clap its shell for a food reward. (He didn't tell me how he got the food to the scallop.) Marine mammal trainers like to boast that they can shape any animal to do anything it is physically and mentally capable of doing, and as far as I can tell, they can.\n\nOne of the effects of shaping sessions, especially if they are fruitful experiences for the subject, is to increase attention span; actually you are shaping duration of participation. However, some organisms naturally do not have long attention spans. Immature organisms - puppies, foals, babies - should never be asked for more than three or four repetitions of a given\n\nbehavior; pressure beyond that may discourage or frighten. This is not to say that immature organisms can't learn. They are learning all the time, but in brief snatches.

Some skills are more easily learned at particular stages of development; a baby mongoose may be tamed and turned into a delightful pet up to the age of six weeks but not after that. Humans are generally thought to acquire languages more easily as children than as adults, although linguists have recently found that an adult who is willing to work at it can probably learn a new language faster than most children and teenagers. One behavior I think is really very difﬁcult to teach to humans in adulthood is swimming. We are among the very few species that do not swim naturally, and while you can teach an adult to ﬂoat and to make the proper strokes, I have never seen anyone frolic or be at ease in deep water unless he or she learned to swim in childhood.",

But when you are reinforcing yourself, the event is never a surprise - the subject always knows what the trainer is up to.

Other people may be successful only after going through three or four different programs, or several repetitions of a given method. Such people can in fact successfully change a habit or give up an addiction, but hardly ever on the ﬁrst try. Still others may be helped enormously by some form of hypnosis or self- hypnosis. A senior editor at a big publishing house told me that he was able to kick a major cigarette habit by learning, from a hypnotist, to relax into a light trance through self-hypnosis, and to repeat as a mantra or charm a phrase such as \"I do not want to smoke\" whenever he felt an overpowering urge. For him, as he put it, this technique seemed to \"drop a curtain\" between him and the cigarette; relief and self-congratulation when the urge had passed was the reinforcer.

The single most useful device in self- reinforcement, I found, was record keeping, which all four programs made use of. I needed to record performance in such a way that improvement could be seen at a glance. I used graphs. Thus my guilt over a lapse could be assuaged by looking at the graphs and seeing that, even so, I was doing much better now than I had been six months previously. Perfection might still be a long way off, but the \"curve,\" or sloping line, of the graph was in the right direction, and this visible proof of improvement, while itself a weak and slow-operating reinforcer, did provide enough motivation to keep me going most of the time.\n\nOne kind of self-administered shaping that works beautifully is training\n\nby computer.

The reinforcer can be verbal, tactile, or whatever you think the roommate would be likely to respond to or accept. People are not dumb; they modify their behavior on just a handful of reinforcers. Even if the scattering of dirty clothes is actually an act of subtle aggression directed against you (\"Pick up my clothes, peon!\"), by using positive reinforcement you can shape a steady and visible progress toward whatever you consider an adequate level of tidiness.\n\nThere are, however, two traps in this use of shaping. The ﬁrst is that it is",

And that can undo the progress. The second trap is that if you are calculating to shape someone's behavior, it is very tempting to talk about it. And talking about it can ruin it. If you say, \"I am going to reinforce you\" - for putting your laundry in the hamper, for not smoking marijuana, for spending less, or whatever - you are bribing or promising, not actually reinforcing; on learning of your plans, the person may rebel, instantly, and escalate misbehavior. To get results, you have to do the shaping, not talk about it.\n\nAnd if you do achieve success in shaping someone else's behavior, you better not brag about it later, either. Some shapers never catch on to this and insist on showing off what \"they\" did - patronizing at best, and a great way\n\nto make a lifelong enemy of the subject. Besides, while you may have helped someone improve a skill or get rid of a bad habit by changing your behavior in order to reinforce appropriately, who actually did all the hard work? The subject. Wise parents never go around talking about what a good job they did raising their kids. For one thing, we all know the job is never over, and for another, the kids deserve the credit - if only for surviving all the training mistakes we made.\n\nBecause the shaping of people can or even must be tacit, it smacks to\n\nsome people of an evil sort of manipulativeness. I think this is a misunderstanding. The reason the shaping needs to be nonverbal is that it is behavior we are working with, not ideas, and not just the subjects' behavior but yours as well.",

Psychologists have discovered in the laboratory a phenomenon called learned helplessness. If an animal is taught to avoid an aversive stimulus, such as an electric shock, by pressing a lever or moving to another part of the cage, and is then placed in a cage where there is absolutely no way it can avoid the shock, it will gradually give up trying. It will become completely malleable and passive, and may even lie there and accept punishment when the way to freedom is once again open. \"Brainwashing\" is possibly a related phenomenon in people. If a person is subjected to severe deprivation and inescapable fear or pain, and if the aversive stimuli are subsequently used as negative reinforcers - that is, as contingencies that the subject can avoid or cause to desist by a change in behavior - well, then ... animals tend to go to pieces, but people are tougher, and some will do anything they need to do to avoid the negative reinforcement.

Some stimuli can cause responses without any learning or training: We ﬂinch at a loud noise, blink at a bright light, and tend to wander into the kitchen when appetizing smells waft out to us; animals would do the same. Such sounds, lights, and scents are called unconditioned, or primary, stimuli.\n\nOther stimuli are learned by association with a reinforced behavior. They\n\nmay be meaningless in themselves, but they have become recognizable signals for behavior: Trafﬁc lights make us stop and go, we leap to answer a ringing telephone, on a noisy street we turn at the sound of our own name, and so on and on. In any given day we respond to a multitude of learned signals. These are called stimuli, cues, or signals.\n\nWe learn the cues or signals because the behavior we associate with them is one that has a history of being reinforced. Picking up a ringing telephone silences the bell (a negative reinforcer) and brings us a human voice (a positive reinforcer, or so one hopes). The signal or discriminative stimulus sets the stage, or gives us the go-ahead, for a behavior that has in the past led to reinforcement. Conversely, the absence of the stimulus informs us that no reinforcer will be forthcoming for that particular behavior. Pick up a telephone that is not ringing, and all you get is a dial tone.",

The drill sergeant with a platoon of recruits and the dog owner in a training class are equally and primarily concerned with getting trainees to obey commands, which are actually discriminative\n\nstimuli. It's not impressive that a dog can sit or a man can halt; what is impressive is that it is done with precision and on command. That is what we call obedience - not merely the acquisition of behaviors but the guarantee that they will be executed when the signal is given. Psychologists call this \"bringing behavior under stimulus control.\" It is hard to train, the training follows rules, and the rules are worth examination.\n\nWhat if you don't care to boss some dog around and never in your life\n\nplan to train a drill team? You can still make use of an understanding of stimulus control. For example, if your kids dawdle and don't come when you call, you have poor stimulus control. If you supervise people, and you sometimes have to give an order or instruction two or three times before it gets done, you have a stimulus-control problem. Did you ever hear these words come out of your mouth: \"If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, don't ... \" (slam the door, or leave your wet bathing suit on the couch, or whatever)? When telling once or a thousand times isn't working, the-behavior is not under stimulus control.",

The subject has to recognize the signal; otherwise it doesn't matter if you yell, or blare it through a rock-band ampliﬁcation system, you'll still get a blank stare. Another human reaction to failure to get a response to a conditioned stimulus is to get mad. This works only if the subject is exhibiting undesirable behavior or not giving a well-learned response to a well-learned cue. Then sometimes an aversive, such as a time out or a show of temper, can elicit good behavior.\n\nSometimes the subject responds correctly but after a delay or in a dilatory manner. Often a sluggish response to commands is due to the fact that the subject has not been taught to respond quickly. Without positive reinforcement, not only for the correct response to a cue but also for prompt response, the subject has had no chance to learn that there are beneﬁts in quick obedience to signals. The behavior really isn't under stimulus control.\n\nReal life abounds in bad management of stimulus control. Whenever one person is trying to exert authority, another person is likely to be getting into\n\ntrouble for \"disobedience\"; but the real problem is commands that are not understood or signals that can't be obeyed - poor communication or sloppy stimulus control.",

Once the behavior is secure, we shape the offering of the behavior during or right after some particular stimulus. For example, with the clicker and reinforcers, we develop the behavior of sitting - quickly neatly, long and often, here on the grass and there on the rug, meeting many criteria - until the dog is offering us sits with great conﬁdence, in the hope of earning reinforcers. Now we introduce the cue as a sort of green light, a chance to earn reinforcers, for that particular behavior.

By and by the learner will identify the cue as the opportunity for that particular behavior to be reinforced: and when you say \"Sit,\" the dog will sit. A second method - and this is what we used with dolphins - is to alternate between cue and no cue. The behavior is happening frequently. You say \"Sit\" and click the next sit. Then you let a sit or two go by unclicked and unreinforced. Then you say \"Sit\" again, and reinforce the sit that follows the cue. You are, in the same training session, reinforcing on-cue sits and extinguishing off-cue sits.\n\nOnce your learner understands the rules, new cues can be attached to new behaviors practically instantly this way. However, difﬁculties may arise with \"green\" or inexperienced animals learning their ﬁrst cues. The source of difﬁculty is the process called extinction. Extinction refers to removing a reinforcer for a behavior that used to pay off. It is an aversive experience (Chapter 4) and may engender emotions.

You then return to clicking the sit after the cue but when the rump is fully on the ground (so the dog doesn't start making a habit of half-sits). The next step is to intersperse some other well-learned behavior - perhaps calling the pup over to be patted - between bouts of giving and reinforcing the new sit cue. The last step is to shape the behavior of waiting for the cue - half a second, then a second, then three seconds - until the dog is visibly attending to you and not offering behavior until the cue comes. When that's done, you can start fading out all those auxiliary cues and just using the word. You have developed cue response as an operant behavior, intentionally offered in the hope of gaining reinforcers.\n\nIn my observation this is the fastest way to establish both individual cues\n\nand the generalization that cues are indicators of which behavior to\n\nperform. A woman brought a four-month-old black Labrador puppy, just adopted from a kennel, to one of my seminars.

Tenor soloists seem to do this a lot. Finally, the conductor may ask for more volume and instead get a lot of mistakes. Amateur choruses do this.

We're all conditioned to give this one behavior in response to any of at least three stimuli.\n\nEstablishing a second cue for a learned behavior is called transferring the stimulus control. To make a transfer, you present the new stimulus - a voice command, perhaps - ﬁrst, and then the old one - a hand signal, say - and reinforce the response; then you gradually make the old stimulus less and less obvious while calling attention to the new one by making it very obvious, until the response is given equally well to the new stimulus, even without giving the old one at all. This usually goes quite a bit faster than the training of the original signal; since \"Do this behavior\" and \"Do this behavior on cue\" have already been established, \"Do this behavior on another cue, too\" is more easily learned.\n\nLearned cues or signals do not have to be of any particular volume or",

A primary, or unconditioned, stimulus produces a gradation of results, depending on its intensity; one reacts more vigorously to a sharp jab than to a pinprick, and the louder the noise, the more it startles. A learned cue, however, merely has to be recognized to lead to the full response. You see a red light and you stop the car; you don't stop faster or slower depending on the size of the light ﬁxture. As long as you recognize the signal you know what to do. Therefore, once a stimulus has been learned, it is possible not only to transfer it but also to make it smaller and smaller, until it is barely perceptible, and still get the same results. Eventually you can get results with a signal so small that it cannot be perceived by a bystander. This is a form of \"fading\" the stimulus.\n\nWe use fading all the time: What has to be a very broad stimulus at ﬁrst\n\n(\"No, Dickie, we do not put sand in other children's hair,\" as you remove Dickie forcibly from the sandbox) becomes, with time, a small signal (merely a lifted eyebrow or wagged index ﬁnger). Animal trainers sometimes get wonderful, apparently magical results with faded stimuli. One of the funniest acts I've seen involved a parrot at the San Diego Wild Animal Park that cackled in hysterical laughter in response to a tiny movement of the trainer's hand. You can see the possibilities: \"Pedro, what do you think of this man's hat?\" \"Hahahahaha ... \" Because the audience did not see the signal, the parrot's single learned behavior seemed the product of a sardonic intelligence cuttingly answering the question; actually, it was a well-timed response to a well-faded stimulus, and the sardonic intelligence, if any, belonged to the trainer, or maybe the scriptwriter.",

As an amateur singer I worked in several opera and symphony choruses, often under guest conductors. While many of the signals conductors give to musicians are more or less standardized, each conductor has personal signals as well. The meaning of these must be established in a very short time; rehearsal time often barely exceeds\n\nperformance time. Once, in a rehearsal of Mahler's \"Resurrection\" symphony, just as the basses were about to make their usual booming entrance, I watched the conductor establish an unconditioned stimulus for \"Come in softly\" by miming an expression of wild alarm and crouching with a hand thrown across his face as if to ward off a blow. Everyone got the message, and in the next few minutes the conductor was able to fade the stimulus, reducing volume in any section of the chorus with a warning glance and a bit of a crouch, or a ﬂeeting echo of the hand gesture, and ﬁnally with just a ﬂinch of the shoulder. Conductors also often transfer stimuli by combining a known or obvious gesture - an upward movement of the palm for \"Louder,\" say - with an unknown gesture such as a personal tilt of the head or turn of the body. Sitting on the conductor's left in the alto section, I once saw a guest conductor momentarily transfer all the altos' louder-softer signals to his left elbow.",

In fact the subject may eventually be able to perceive signals so subtle that the trainer is not even aware of giving them. One classic example is the case of Clever Hans, a horse in Germany at the turn of the century, which was said to be a genius. By pawing with its foot it could count, do arithmetic, spell out words, and even do square roots; right answers were, of course, rewarded with a tidbit. The owner, a retired schoolteacher, truly thought he had taught the horse to read, think, do math, and communicate. Indeed the animal would \"answer\" questions when the owner was not present.\n\nMany learned gentlemen traveled to Berlin to study Clever Hans and\n\nwere convinced the horse was a genius. One psychologist, however, eventually demonstrated that the horse was being cued somehow, in that if no one in the room knew the answer, the horse would paw indeﬁnitely. It took much further investigation - over the protests of those who were convinced the horse really was a genius - to demonstrate that the cue to stop pawing was a minuscule lift of the owner's or any questioner's head when the right number was reached, a movement originally exaggerated by a broad-brimmed hat the schoolteacher wore but by now so small that it was not only almost impossible to see (except by Clever Hans) but almost\n\nimpossible to suppress by conscious effort. That was how the horse could tell when to stop pawing from watching people other than its owner.",

Targeting is a favorite device of many marine mammal trainers; you'll see targets in use at almost any marine park. Trainers hold out a ﬁst for the sea lion to touch, and then move the sea lion around the stage by moving the ﬁst. Dolphins are taught to jump straight up to bump a ball hung high above the water. Sometimes two or three trainers, each with a ball or padded target on a pole, are stationed around the pool to provide a series of targets for a whale swimming from point to point.\n\nTeaching an animal to touch the end of a stick with its nose is an\n\nexcellent beginning exercise for the new reinforcement trainer. You can see and feel the behavior; it's easy to reinforce, and easy to see how to raise criteria in small steps: two inches from the nose, four inches, to the left, right, up, down, and then forward, until the animal (or the bird, or the ﬁsh) is following the target stick around. The owner of a dog training school in Holland told me that one morning she clicker-trained her house cat to target on her coffee spoon and thus was able to lead it all around the breakfast table. The experience was so convincing that she immediately converted her entire school to clicker training.",

One can use a target stick to teach a rambunctious, out-of-control dog to walk nicely in heel position. No jerking on the leash, no elaborate training, just longer and longer stretches of \"Keep your nose just about here for a click and a treat.\" You can stick the target stick in the ground and use it to teach the dog to go away from you on cue, something obedience competitors often ﬁnd difﬁcult. You can put the dog through obstacles, or into new places, with a target. Police trainers and search-and-rescue dog trainers are using a laser pointer to send dogs into particular areas. Cats, also, will readily learn to chase the little red dot that the laser pointer projects.

One day she was assigned to work with an extremely active little boy with developmental deﬁcits. The work required him to sit at a desk; but their usual classroom was busy, so they were sent to work in the gym. Surrounded by big balls and rockers and climbing equipment, the child, of course, ran off to play. She could not physically make him sit at the table, nor did she want to. So she held out her palm and said \"Touch.\" He did. \"Good.\" With \"touch\" and \"good\" she was able to lead him to his chair and keep him there long enough to get the work done, with short bouts of romping inserted periodically. (Knowing you can get your learner back, with a cue such as a target, makes one much more willing to use freedom as a reinforcer!) I have also witnessed targets, including the teacher's hand and the laser pointer, being used to help profoundly low-functioning individuals learn to walk to their classrooms, or desks, or other destinations, voluntarily and without physical guidance - a liberating skill for the learner and the teacher both.\n\nThe one case where magnitude of a discriminative stimulus might seem to make a difference is in the traditional training of domestic animals. Often\n\nthe cue - a tug on the reins, or on the leash, a nudge in the horse's ribs - is a watered-down version of the original unconditioned stimulus, the harsher pull or jerk or hard kick that provoked an untrained response. So if the gentle stimulus doesn't work, it seems as if you should get a bigger response with a bigger stimulus. Efforts to put this into practice lead to problems, however.",

If they don't get a response to, say, a gentle pull, they pull a little harder, then a little harder than that, all quite futilely as the horse or dog is pulling with equally increasing force in the opposite direction.\n\nConventional trainers tend to treat the cue and the use of force separately; they give the signal, and if it is not obeyed, they skip any gradations and immediately elicit the behavior with an extremely strong aversive stimulus - enough to \"refresh his memory,\" as one horse trainer puts it. This is the function of the choke chain used in dog training. Properly taught, even a small person using such a collar can give a quick jerk-and- release powerful enough to knock a Great Dane off its feet. With this primary stimulus in reserve, one can quickly develop good response to a very gentle tug. As British trainer Barbara Woodhouse pointed out, it is in the long run far kinder than perpetually tugging and hauling on the poor beast's neck at some intermediate and meaningless level of force. Shaping the same behavior with positive reinforcers is, of course, even kinder, and also more effective in the short and the long run. Modern dog trainers now use positive reinforcers and a marker signal, such as a word or a click, to accomplish all of the traditional dog behaviors that used to be trained by force.",

The dog wears a collar with a receiver in it. If the dog gets too near the line, the collar shocks it. However, a few feet before that point, the collar gives a warning buzz. The warning buzzer is a discriminative stimulus for \"Don't go any further.\" If the setup is properly installed, a trained dog can be effectively conﬁned and will never receive an actual shock. I used such a fence when my terrier and I lived in a house in the woods. An actual fence would have been a perpetual invitation to try to dig under it or escape through an open gate; the conditioned warning signal and the Invisible Fence were far more secure.\n\nA very useful technique for getting a prompt response to a\n\ndiscriminative stimulus is the limited hold. Let us say your subject has learned to offer a behavior in response to a cue, but there is usually some gap in time between presentation of the stimulus and the subject's response. You call folks for supper, and in due course they come; or you signal a halt, and your elephant gradually slows to a stop.\n\nIf you wish, by using a limited hold, you can actually shape this interval\n\ndownward until the behavior occurs as fast as is physically possible. You start by estimating the normal interval in which the behavior usually occurs; then you reinforce only behavior that occurs during that interval. Since living creatures are variable, some responses will fall outside the interval, and those no longer earn reinforcers. For example, if you serve supper a set time after calling, rather than waiting for stragglers, stragglers may get cold food or less choice of food.",

The expression describing this event comes from human anticipatory behavior in footraces: jumping the gun. People who anticipate cues or requests of others are generally perceived to be overeager, fawning, or obsequious; it's an irritating habit, not a virtue.\n\nDoberman pinschers sometimes run into trouble in obedience\n\ncompetitions. Although they are marvelously trainable dogs, they are so alert that they anticipate commands by the smallest of hints and often work before they have actually been told to, thus losing points. Anticipation is a common fault in calf-roping horses in rodeos. The cowboy and horse are supposed to wait behind a barrier for the calf to be given a head start, but the horse, excited, plunges off before the signal. The cowboy sometimes thinks he's got a real goer, but what he's really got is incompletely trained stimulus control. Another very common occurrence of anticipation is the \"offsides\" call in football. One player is so eager that he moves into the other team's territory before the signal to play is given, and the team must be penalized.\n\nOne way to cure anticipation is to use time-outs. If the subject\n\nanticipates the cue, and if that is undesirable, stop all activity. Give no cues and do nothing for one full minute. Every time the subject jumps the gun again, reset the clock. You are penalizing overeagerness by making it the cause of delay of the chance to work. This will effectively extinguish anticipating a command when rebuke, punishment, or repetition might have no effect at all.",

These long strings of behavior are behavior chains. Unlike simple long-duration behaviors - do this for an hour, do this a hundred times - they can be maintained comfortably, without deterioration or delayed starts, because each behavior is actually reinforced by the signal or opportunity to perform the next behavior, until the ﬁnal reinforcement of a job completed.\n\nThere are several kinds of behavior chains. Homogeneous chains are chains in which the same behavior is repeated over and over again, like a horse going over a series of identical jumps in a row. Heterogeneous chains consist of various different behaviors that are reinforced only when the last behavior is completed. Most formal dog obedience competition exercises are heterogeneous chains. In one midlevel exercise, for example, the dog is required (1) to sit at the owner's side while the owner tosses a dumbbell beyond a jump, and then (2) on hearing the cue, go over the jump and (3) locate and pick up the dumbbell and (4) turn around and jump back over the jump while carrying the dumbbell and (5) sit in front of the owner until the\n\nowner takes the dumbbell and (6) return, on cue, to the sit-at-heel position. In competition these chains are always performed in the same sequence. They may, however, be trained as individual behaviors or as parts of the chain in other sequences.",

The same dog, in a hunting or herding trial, might perform a long series of learned behaviors that might vary considerably in sequence from one day to the next depending on the environment. The whole sequence, however, would eventually be reinforced when the pheasant is retrieved or the sheep are in the pen.\n\nWhat makes behavior chains work is that each behavior has a history of reinforcement, and each behavior is under stimulus control, or on cue. Thus the learned cues, which are guarantees of future reinforcers, maintain behaviors within the chain. The cues can be given by a handler: The shepherd, with whistles, can tell the sheepdog exactly which way to turn, how fast to go, when to stop, and when to return. The cues can also be provided by the environment. Once the obedience competition dog has gone over the jump, the sight of the dumbbell is the cue to pick it up, the pickup is a cue to return to the owner, and the sight of the jump is the cue to jump back over it again. The owner need not provide verbal cues for those parts of the chain, but the cues are there.",

You can't reinforce the subject with a cue if it doesn't recognize the cue, or if it cannot accomplish what the cue indicates. This means that behavior chains should be trained backward. Start with the last behavior in the chain; make sure it has been learned and that the signal to begin it is recognized; then train the next-to-last one, and so on. For example, in memorizing a poem, a piece of music, a speech, or lines in a play, if you divide the task up into, say, ﬁve sections, and memorize the sections in reverse order, starting with the last, you will always be going from weakness to strength, from the stuff you're not quite sure of yet into the great, reinforcing, well-memorized stuff you know cold. Memorizing material in the order in which it is written and will be presented necessitates plowing continuously from familiar ground into the more difﬁcult and unknown, a most unreinforcing experience. Treating memorization tasks as behavior chains not only shortens the needed memorizing time considerably, it also makes the whole experience more pleasant.\n\nBehavior chains are a peculiar concept. I've often been thwarted by them\n\nmyself, feeling that I'm pushing at the end of a string because I can't get an animal, or a child, or myself, to do some apparently simple series of things, until I realize that I'm trying to train a behavior chain from the wrong end.

This is a pity, because playing Frisbee is an excellent way to exercise a big dog in the city. The Frisbee is a much slower and more erratic target than a simple ball, more like real prey perhaps, encouraging the dog into leaps and fancy catches that are fun for the owner, too. And playing Frisbee allows the owner to stand in one place and still run the dog's legs off.\n\nWhat people complain of is that their dog, when encouraged, will leap for the Frisbee and try to grab it as it is waved around, but when they throw it, the dog just stands there and watches it go. Or the dog chases and grabs it, but never brings it back.\n\nThere are two training problems in this game: The ﬁrst is that the distance the dog goes after the Frisbee must be shaped. The second is that the game is a behavior chain: First the dog chases the Frisbee, then the dog catches the Frisbee, then the dog brings the Frisbee back for another throw. So each behavior must be trained separately, and the last behavior in the chain, retrieving, must be trained ﬁrst.\n\nYou can teach retrieving over very short distances - indoors, even - with\n\nsomething easy to hold: an old sock, maybe. Hunting dogs almost do it spontaneously. Other breeds, such as bulldogs and boxers, may have to be carefully shaped to drop or give back the item, since they tend to prefer playing tug-of-war.",

Then you hold it in the air, let him have it when he leaps for it, and make him give it back. Then you toss it momentarily into the air and make a big fuss when he catches it. When he has the idea, you can start shaping the ﬁrst behavior of the chain, the chase, by tossing the Frisbee up and out from you a few feet\n\nso the dog has to move off after it, to catch it. And now you are on your way to having a great Frisbee dog.\n\nAs the distance grows longer, the dog needs to learn to watch the Frisbee\n\nand place himself well for the catch. This takes practice, so it might take a couple of weekends to get the dog going out twenty-ﬁve feet or so. A fast dog will eventually be able to get under and catch a Frisbee as far as you can throw it - the star Frisbee dog Ashley Whippet could catch a Frisbee thrown the length of a football ﬁeld. Dogs seem to relish their own expertise. A brilliant run or a terriﬁc over-the-shoulder four-legs-off-the- ground catch that brings cheers from spectators also makes the dog sparkle all over. Nevertheless, after that catch the dog brings the Frisbee back because you trained that end of the chain ﬁrst, and because that is what earns him the reinforcement, whether it is praise from you or another toss of the Frisbee.",

This means it is high time to quit - you've both had your fun.\n\nWith most animals, you have to go to some lengths to establish stimulus\n\ncontrol at ﬁrst, but often by the time you start bringing the third or fourth behavior under stimulus control, you will ﬁnd that the animal seems to have generalized, or come to some conceptual understanding. After learning three or four cued behaviors, most subjects seem to recognize that certain events are signals, each signal means a different behavior, and acquiring reinforcers depends upon recognizing and responding correctly to signals. From then on, establishment of learned stimuli is easy. The subject already has the picture, and all it has to do is learn to identify new signals and associate them with the right behaviors. Since you, as trainer, are helping all you can by making that very clear, subsequent training can itself go much faster than the initial laborious steps.",

No coercion. Just \"Okay, everybody, the ﬁrst thing we're going to do is take our chewing gum out of our mouths. Good! Oops, wait, Doreen's still got some ... great! She took it out!

Of course it gives no response and goes unreinforced.

Good stimulus control is nothing more than true communication - honest, fair communication. It is the most complex, difﬁcult, and elegant aspect of training with positive reinforcement.",

We tend to think of these things as punishment (Method 2), and they may or may not be seen as punishments by the subjects, but these are Method 1 techniques. Fundamentally they eliminate the behavior by restraining the subject physically from the performance, or by eliminating the presence of the subject.\n\nThe vital thing to understand about Method 1 is that it teaches the subject nothing. Preventing the subject from exhibiting the behavior - by restraint, conﬁnement, divorce, electrocution - does not teach the subject much about the behavior. It seems reasonable that a man sent to prison for theft will think twice before he steals again, but we know that very often that is far from the case; all we can be sure of is that he cannot rip off your TV while he is locked up.\n\nBehavior is not necessarily reasonable. If it has already been established as a way to earn reinforcement, and if the motivation and circumstances that elicit the behavior are present, the behavior is likely to manifest itself again.\n\nWhile the subject is under restraint, no relearning about the behavior goes on; you cannot modify behavior that is not occurring. The child shut up in his or her room may be learning something (to resent and fear you, perhaps) but not how to engage in polite social conversation.

Most dogs quickly regard their crate as home and will retire to it voluntarily during the day.\n\nEven small puppies prefer not to soil their sleeping quarters.

Suppose we have punished a child, or a dog, or an employee for some behavior, and the behavior occurs again. Do we say, \"Hmm, punishment isn't working; let's try something else\"? No. We escalate the punishment. If scolding doesn't work, try a slap. If your kid has a bad report card, take away his bike. If the next report card is also bad, take away his skateboard, too.

The subject therefore may not connect the punishment to his or her previous deeds; animals never do, and people often fail to. If a ﬁnger fell off every time someone stole something, or if cars burst into ﬂames when they were parked illegally, I expect stolen property and parking tickets would be nearly nonexistent.\n\nIn Method 2, as in Method 1, the subject learns nothing. While prompt punishment may stop an ongoing behavior, it does not cause any particular improvement to occur. Punishment does not teach a child how to achieve a better report card. The most the punisher can hope for is that the child's motivation will change: The child will try to alter future behavior in order to avoid future punishment.\n\nLearning to alter behavior in the future in order to avoid consequences in\n\nthe future is more than most animals can understand. If a man catches his bird dog and beats it because it has been chasing rabbits, the dog has no way of knowing which particular recent activity is being reprimanded. It may become more fearful of the owner, which might allow the owner, from then on, to call it off when it chases rabbits, or might cause the dog to run away even faster when called. The beating in itself will not affect rabbit chasing in itself.\n\nCats, incidentally, seem particularly dense about associating their punishments with their crimes. Like birds, they merely become frightened when threatened, and they learn nothing, which is why people think cats are difﬁcult to train. They really can't be trained by punitive methods, but they're a snap to train with positive reinforcement.",

Evasiveness increases rapidly under a punishment regimen - a sad situation in a family setting and not so great in society at large either. Also, repeated or severe punishment has some very nasty side effects: fear, anger, resentment, resistance, even hate in the punished one and sometimes in the punisher, too. These mental states are not conducive to learning (unless you want the subject to learn fear, anger, and hatred, emotions that are sometimes deliberately established in the training of terrorists).\n\nOne reason we keep thinking punishment works is that sometimes - if the subject understands which action is being punished, if the motivation for doing the behavior is small, if the fear of future punishment is large, and ﬁnally, if the subject can control the behavior in the ﬁrst place (punishment\n\ndoesn't cure bed-wetting, for example) - the punished behavior stops. A child who is scolded severely the ﬁrst time he or she crayons on the wall may very well stop defacing the house. A citizen who cheats on his income tax and gets ﬁned for it may not try it again.\n\nPunishment has the best chance of halting a behavior in its tracks if the behavior is caught early, so that it has not become an established habit, and if punishment itself is a novel experience for the subject, a shock to which the person or animal has not become hardened.",

Punishment - scolding and so on - may keep the dog off the couch when you are there, but not when you are absent. One old training trick is to set a few small mousetraps and put them on the couch: punishment in absentia. Then, when the dog jumps up, the mousetraps go off, startling and perhaps pinching him. The mousetraps punish jumping on the couch. This event also negatively reinforces, or strengthens, the behavior of staying on the ﬂoor in order to avoid mousetraps. The dog's own action triggered the aversive event, and one bad experience can be sufﬁcient to eliminate the behavior of sneaking onto the couch. I hasten to add that this is likely to work with some dogs but not others. One boxer owner reported that his dog, faced with mousetraps for the second time, dragged a blanket down from the back of the couch onto the mousetraps, set off the traps, and then lay on the blanket on the couch.",

I have seen it exhibited and defended by disciplinarian schoolteachers,\n\nbullying athletic coaches, domineering bosses, and well-intentioned parents. Their own punishing behavior may be maintained by a meager handful of successes in a morass of not-so-good results and can persist despite logical evidence to the contrary - despite the presence of other teachers in the same school, other coaches, heads of other businesses, other generals, presidents, or parents who can be seen to be getting results that are just as good or better without using punishment at all.\n\nPunishment often constitutes revenge. The punisher may not really care\n\nwhether the victim's behavior changes or not; he or she is just getting revenge, sometimes not against the recipient but against society at large. Think of obdurate clerks who, with concealed glee, delay or prevent you from getting your license, your loan, or your library pass over some minor technicality; you get punished and they get even.\n\nPunishing is also reinforcing for the punisher because it demonstrates and helps to maintain dominance. Until the day when a boy is big enough to hit his brutal father back, the father feels dominant and is in truth the dominant one.

The horse learns to turn left when the left rein is pulled, because by doing so it can ameliorate the tugging feeling in the left corner of its mouth. Elephants, oxen, camels, and other beasts of burden learn to move forward, halt, pull loads, and so on to avoid the tug of a halter, the poke or blow of a prod, goad, or whip.\n\nNegative reinforcement can be used to shape behavior. As with positive\n\nreinforcement, the reinforcer must be contingent upon the behavior; one must cease \"prodding\" when the response is correct. Unfortunately, because the prodding, in whatever form, results in a change in behavior, the behavior of the person doing the prodding may be positively reinforced, so that, as with punishing, the tendency to lay on with the aversives increases. Naggers, for example, may eventually get results, and this is reinforcing to the nagger. So nagging escalates, sometimes so much that the nagger goes on nagging whether the desired response has occurred or not. Think of the mother in Portnoy's Complaint who complains, while her son is visiting, \"We never see you!\"\n\nPositive and negative reinforcement contingencies are often reciprocal.",

The tantruming is positively reinforced by the candy, but the more powerful event is that the parent is negatively reinforced for giving in, since the public tantrum, so aversive and embarrassing for the parent, actually stopped.\n\nTantrums can become part of a vicious circle. The parent will go to all kinds of lengths - soothing, protesting, arguing, and reinforcing - to stop a tantrum. So the tantrums escalate, and because they do, the parents inadvertently reinforcing efforts escalate as well. I know of one household in which a child threw a full-blown, ﬁfteen- or twenty-minute screaming tantrum nearly every night, just at dinnertime. Both the child's behavior and the parents' anxious responses were so strongly maintained, by interlocking\n\npositive and negative reinforcements, that the behavior continued for over three years.\n\nPeople use spontaneous negative reinforcers on each other all the time:\n\nthe warning glance, the frown, the disapproving remark. Some children's lives, and some spouses' lives too, are ﬁlled with constant daily effort to behave in such a way as to avoid disapproval. The overpunished child may become hostile, evasive, and a punisher himself in adulthood. In contrast, the child that grows up striving not to please, exactly, but to bring a halt, if only temporarily, to chronic disapproval, may become timid, self-doubting, and anxious in adult life. A therapist specializing in phobic patients tells me that her clients, with their crippling irrational fears of crowds or elevators, were all raised on a steady diet of negative reinforcement.",

As Murray Sidman, Ph.D., has observed to me, \"A few successful applications of even mild negative reinforcement may turn a trainer into an invariable user of negative reinforcement.\"\n\nHowever, because negative reinforcers are aversive - something the subject wants to avoid - every instance of their use contains a punisher. Pull on the left rein, and you are punishing going straight ahead, as well as negatively reinforcing turning to the left when that occurs. The traditional trainer typically doesn't think of his negative reinforcers - his reins or choke chains or verbal corrections - as punishment. After all, trainers explain, these tools are gently used, on the whole: if the trainer really wanted to punish, there are much more severe corrections available. And, the argument typically continues, if you use a lot of praise and positive reinforcers as well, no harm is done in the long run.\n\nHowever, the strength of the aversive can only be judged by the recipient. What the trainer may consider to be mild may be seen by the trainee as blisteringly severe. Furthermore, since all negative reinforcement, by deﬁnition, includes a punisher, making a practice of using negative reinforcement puts you at risk for all the unpredictable fallout of punishment: avoidance, secrecy, fear, confusion, resistance, passivity, and reduced initiative, as well as spillover associations, in which anything that",

I have attended national-level dog obedience competitions and been startled by the glum faces, unwagged tails, and cautious, inhibited movements of many of the top-level performance dogs. Go to any riding academy or horseback event, and ask yourself if the horses look cheerful. Most people, even professional equestrians, and even those who consider themselves to be modern and humane trainers, don't know what a happy-eyed horse looks like. They've never seen one. Negative reinforcers can be benign, as illustrated earlier in the matter of the shy llama. My daughter's dog is affectionate and likes to lick the baby's face. The baby, a year old, likes the dog but doesn't like having his face washed. He has learned that if he puts his hands out and squawks, the dog will stop. Now when the dog approaches, tail wagging, the baby produces his baby version of \"No way!\" and the lick is forestalled.

It's far better to use Method 8 (Change the motivation) by putting the objects out of reach, or Method 5 (Train an incompatible behavior) by giving the baby something else to play with - or both. Babies are not programmed to learn easily to avoid aversives, though they can learn rapidly through positive reinforcement. One might say that babies are born to please, not to obey.\n\nBaby animals also tend to learn more easily through positive\n\nreinforcement and to be bewildered and frightened by punishment and negative reinforcers. Conventional dog trainers usually do not advise formal obedience training until a dog is six months of age. The reason they give is\n\nthat the puppy is too young to learn; but the real problem is that formal training is generally aversive, and the puppy is too young to learn that particular way. With praise and petting and food, you can teach a puppy almost anything, starting even before weaning, but put a choke chain on it and try to force it to heel, sit, or stay, and you will cow and frighten the puppy before you can teach it much.",

If you pull, it pulls back automatically, and if you are too insistent and pull too hard, the wolf, no matter how calm and sociable it usually is, panics and tries to escape.\n\nPut a tame pet otter on a leash, and either you go where the otter wants to go, or it ﬁghts the leash with all its might.

All domesticated animals are susceptible to negative reinforcement - they can be herded, led, shooed, or generally pushed around. We humans, intentionally or accidentally, have selectively bred this characteristic into them. After all, the cow that cannot be herded or shooed, that like a wolf or dolphin either resists the aversive stimulus or panics and ﬂees, is the cow that's going to end up outside the kraal at night and get eaten by lions; or, as\n\na nuisance, it will be the cow most likely to be killed and eaten by the people. Her genes won't stay in the gene pool.\n\nObedience, whether expressed as a willingness to knuckle under or as a\n\nhesitation in the ﬁght-or-ﬂight reaction in which mild negative reinforcement may be used to coerce learning, is built into all of our domestic animals - with one exception: the cat. It is, for example, really hard to teach a cat to walk on a leash; go to a cat show, and you will see that the professionals don't even bother to try - cats are carried or cats are caged, but they are not walked around on leashes.\n\nHarry Frank suggests that this is because the cat is not a true domestic animal and therefore lacks that susceptibility to negative reinforcement. It may, rather, be a commensal, an animal that, like the rat and the cockroach, shares our abodes to its beneﬁt. More probably the cat is a symbiote, an animal that trades favors with us for mutual beneﬁt - food, shelter, and patting from us; mouse catching, entertainment, and purring from the cat. Work and obedience, however, no. Which may explain why some people don't like cats: They fear the uncontrollability.",

It refers to the extinction not of an animal but of a behavior, a behavior I that dies down by itself for lack of reinforcement, like a burnt-out candle.\n\nBehavior that produces no results - not good results or bad results, just no results - will probably extinguish. This does not always mean you can ignore a behavior and it will go away. The behavior of ignoring a human being is a result in itself, being such an unsocial thing to do. One cannot always count on extinguishing behavior in another by ignoring it.\n\nIf a behavior has been reinforced by attention, ignoring it may work. I\n\nonce watched Thomas Schippers, the symphony conductor, running a rehearsal of the New York Philharmonic. A ferocious conductor - but a ferocious orchestra, too. As Schippers walked to the podium, the orchestra was being naughty; a woodwind warbled \"I wish I was in Dixie,\" and a violin made an incredibly human \"Oh-oh.\" Schippers ignored the foolery, and it quickly extinguished.\n\nExtinction in human interactions best applies, it seems to me, to verbal behavior - whining, quarreling, teasing, bullying. If these kinds of behavior do not produce results, do not get a rise out of you, they extinguish. Keep in mind that getting someone's goat can be positively reinforcing.

For example, some people do not like to have dogs begging at the dining-room table. I hate it myself - there is nothing more likely to curb my appetite than doggy breath, sad-dog eyes, and a heavy paw on my knee just as I am lifting a piece of steak to my mouth.\n\nA Method 1 solution is to put the dog outside or shut it in another room during mealtimes. But it is also possible to control begging by training an incompatible behavior - for example, training a dog to lie in the dining- room doorway when people are eating. First you train the dog to lie down, thereby bringing the behavior under stimulus control. You can then make the dog \"Go lie down\" elsewhere during meals. You reward this behavior with food in the kitchen after the plates are cleared. Going away and lying down is incompatible with begging at the table; a dog cannot physically be two places at once, and so begging is eliminated.",

The whole chorus suddenly fell out of synchrony with the orchestra. It seemed they had memorized one measure of music a beat short. Having identiﬁed the problem, the conductor looked for an \"s\" in the lyrics of that measure, found one, and told the chorus to stress that \"s\": \"The king'sssss coming.\" It made a funny buzzing sound, but it was incompatible with rushing through the measure too fast, and it solved the problem.\n\nMy own ﬁrst use of Method 5 was in the handling of a potentially very serious dolphin problem. At one time at Sea Life Park we had three kinds of performers in the outdoor show: a group of six dainty little spinner dolphins, a huge female bottlenose named Apo, and a pretty Hawaiian girl who swam and played with the spinner dolphins during part of the show. Contrary to popular opinion, dolphins are not always friendly, and bottlenoses in particular are apt to bully and tease. Apo, the six-hundred- pound bottlenose, took to harassing the swimmer when she got in the water, dashing under her and boosting her into the air, or slapping her on the head with her tail ﬂukes. It terriﬁed the girl, and it was indeed very dangerous.\n\nWe did not want to take Apo out of the show, since her leaps and ﬂips made her its star. We started constructing a pen in which she could be shut during the swimmer's performance - a Method 1 solution - but meanwhile we trained an incompatible behavior. We got Apo to press on an underwater lever, at the pool's edge, in return for ﬁsh rewards.",

During shows a trainer put Apo's lever in the pool and reinforced lever pressing whenever the swimmer was out in midwater playing with the spinners. Apo could not press her lever and simultaneously be in the middle of the pool beating up the swimmer; the two behaviors were incompatible. Fortunately Apo preferred lever pressing to swimmer harassment, so the behavior was eliminated. (The swimmer, however, never quite trusted this magic and calmed down completely only when Apo was back safely behind bars.)\n\nTraining an incompatible behavior is a good way to attack a faulty tennis\n\nswing or any other muscular pattern that has been learned wrong. Muscles \"learn\" slowly but well; once something has become part of your movement\n\npatterns it is hard to unlearn. (Piano lessons were frustrating to me as a child because it seemed in every piece my ﬁngers would learn one note wrong and stumble in the same place every time.) One way to deal with this is to train an incompatible behavior. Using a tennis swing as an example, ﬁrst take the movement apart in your mind - posture, position, footwork, start, middle, and end - and go very slowly through each portion of the movement, or many times through just one portion if necessary. Train a completely different swing, a set of new motions. When the muscles begin to learn the new pattern, you can put it together and speed it up.",

But while you may never get rid of the old pattern completely, you can reduce it to a minimum by replacing it with the new one.

You can use this natural law to get rid of all kinds of things you don't want, simply by bringing the behavior under the control of a cue ... and then never giving the cue.\n\nI ﬁrst discovered the use of this elegant method while training a dolphin to wear blindfolds. We wanted to give a demonstration of dolphin sonar, or echolocation, in our public shows at Sea Life Park. I intended to train a male bottlenose dolphin named Makua to wear rubber suction cups over his eyes and then, temporarily blinded, to locate and retrieve objects underwater using his echolocation system. The behavior has become a standard item in oceanarium shows nowadays.\n\nThe blindfolds didn't hurt Makua, but he didn't care for them. By and by, when he saw the suction cups in my hands, he took to sinking to the bottom of the tank and staying there. He would lie there for up to ﬁve minutes at a time, waving his tail gently and watching me up through the water with a \"Gotcha!\" look in his eye. I judged it would be unproﬁtable to try to scare or poke him up to the surface, and foolish to bribe or lure him. So one day, when he sank on me, I rewarded him with the whistle and a bunch of ﬁsh.",

If you are on your way to someplace wonderful - the circus, say - the children may be noisy because they are excited, too excited to be amenable to Method 5, playing games and singing songs. And on a happy occasion you don't want to use Method 3, negative reinforcement, by pulling over and stopping the car until they are quiet. Now Method 6 is useful: Bring the behavior under stimulus control. \"Okay, everybody make as much noise as you possibly can, starting now!\" (You make noise, too.) This is a lot of fun for about thirty seconds, and then it palls. Two or three repetitions are usually more than enough to ensure reasonable quiet for the rest of the ride.

When the black side was out, no amount of yapping would make the people inside open the door. When the white side was out, the dog would be let in.

The person who has enough to eat is not going to steal a loaf of bread.\n\nA common sight I always wince at is the mother whose small child is having a tantrum in the supermarket and who is jerking on the kid's arm to make it hush up. Of course one can empathize - the tantrum is embarrassing, and jerking is a surreptitious way to shock the child into silence, less conspicuous than yelling or smacking. (It's also a good way to dislocate a little child's elbow or shoulder, as any orthopedic surgeon can tell you.) The problem is usually that the child is hungry, and the sight and smell of all that food is too much for it. Very few young mothers have someone to leave the kids with while they market, and working mothers often have to market right before dinnertime, when they themselves are tired and hungry and hence irritable.\n\nThe solution is to feed the kids before or while going to the market; any\n\nsort of junk food would be preferable to the distressing scenes that upset child, mother, checkout clerks, and everyone else within range.\n\nSome behaviors are self-reinforcing - that is, the very enactment of the behavior is a reinforcement. Gum chewing, smoking, and thumb sucking are examples. The best way to get rid of these behaviors in yourself or another is to change the motivation. I gave up chewing gum as a child because an aunt told me it made girls look cheap, and not looking \"cheap\" was a lot more important to me than the pleasure of chewing gum. Smokers quit when their motives for smoking are met in other ways or when motivation to stop - fear of cancer, say - outweighs the reinforcers of smoking. Thumb sucking stops when a child's level of conﬁdence is high enough that he or she no longer needs the self-comforting.",

By and large it lies outside the scope of this book, but because it has been necessary to discuss motivation as it relates to undesirable behavior, perhaps this is the place to discuss a training device sometimes used to heighten motivation: deprivation. The theory is if an animal is working for positive reinforcement, the more it needs that reinforcer, the harder and more reliably it will work. Laboratory rats and pigeons are often conditioned with food reinforcers. To heighten their motivation, they are fed less food than they would eat on their own. It is customary to give them just enough to keep them at 85 percent of normal body weight. This is called food deprivation.\n\nDeprivation has become such a standard technique in experimental\n\npsychology that when I started training, I assumed it was probably a necessity in working with rats and pigeons. Of course we did not use deprivation with dolphins. Our dolphins were given all they would eat whether they'd earned it or not at the end of each day since dolphins that do not get enough to eat often become sick and die.\n\nIt did occur to me in those days that I was using food and social\n\nreinforcers with ponies and children, quite successfully, without ﬁrst having to reduce the baseline supply of love or nourishment to get results. Perhaps food deprivation was necessary only with simpler organisms, such as rats and pigeons?

I also thought that only young animals were used for training. All the working animals I had ever seen were comparatively small, between one hundred and two hundred pounds, and I knew that sea lions in the wild get quite large.\n\nDave Butcher, director of training for Sea World in Florida, showed me more than I'd imagined possible. His sea lions worked for social and tactile reinforcers as well as ﬁsh, and of course for conditioned reinforcers and on variable schedules as well. Consequently they did not have to be kept hungry in order to make them perform; during and after the day's performances, the sea lions could have all the ﬁsh they wanted. One result was that the sea lions were not snarly and crabby, as any hungry animal might be. They were friendly to those humans they knew, and they enjoyed being touched. I was astonished to see trainers on their lunch hour sunbathing in a pile with their sea lions, each young man resting against the ample ﬂank of one sea lion, with the head of another sea lion in his lap. Another result of the discontinuance of food deprivation was that these sea lions grew ... and grew!

In animals such activity is called displacement behavior. A dog in a situation of tension - for instance, when being coaxed over to be petted by a stranger - may suddenly sit down and scratch itself. Two horses threatening each other in a dominance conﬂict may suddenly go through the motions of grazing. Displacement behavior very often consists of self-grooming activities. In animals under conditions of conﬁnement, the behavior may be carried out so repetitiously that it leads to self-mutilation. Birds preen their feathers until they have plucked themselves bare; cats lick a paw until they have created an open wound. Nail biting (and hair pulling, scratching, and other grooming behaviors) can be carried to this extreme in people, and yet even pain does not stop the behavior.\n\nBecause the behavior does indeed distract one from stress momentarily,",

I think there is a fourth step in the evolution of an idea: The idea is not only accepted, but understood, cherished, and put to work. This is what I see beginning to happen with positive reinforcement, especially among people who have grown up with Skinnerian concepts in the Zeitgeist, in the air around them - people, that is, who have been born since 1950. They take to positive reinforcement and shaping without fear or resistance, as children nowadays take to the computers that their parents may still shrink from. They share techniques with their elders, and they infect those around them with their enthusiasm. Let me give you some examples I ﬁnd heartening.\n\nFrom my casual observations, the training of most team sports - pro football, for example - continues in the good old Neanderthal tradition: lots of deprivation, punishment, favoritism, and verbal and mental abuse. The training of individual sports, however, seems to be undergoing a revolution. In fact, it was a symptom of that revolution that prompted the writing of this book. At a dinner party in Westchester County, New York, I was seated next to my hostess's tennis pro, a nice young man from Australia. He said to me,\n\n\"I hear you were a dolphin trainer. Do you know about Skinner and all that?\"\n\n\"Well, tell me, where can I get a book about Skinner that will help me be",

Meanwhile, I pondered the amazing fact that this person, and presumably many like him, knew exactly what was needed. It meant there are people out there who already have a grasp of reinforcement training and want to know more about it.\n\nAt that time I was living in New York City. Partly for relief from house- pent, sedentary city life, and partly from a trainer's curiosity, I began to take a few lessons in various kinds of physical activities ranging from name- brand exercise classes to squash, sailing, skiing (both downhill and cross- country), ﬁgure skating, and dance.\n\nTo my surprise, only one of the instructors I worked under (the exercise-\n\nclass teacher) relied on traditional browbeating and ridicule to elicit behavior. All the rest used well-timed positive reinforcers and often very ingenious shaping procedures. This contrasted sharply with my earlier memories of physical instruction - ballet classes, riding lessons, gym classes at school and college - none of which I shined in, and all of which I feared as much as enjoyed. Take ice skating, for example. I took ﬁgure- skating lessons as a child at a large and successful skating school. The instructor showed us what to do, and then we practiced and struggled until we could do it while the instructor corrected our posture and arm positions and exhorted us to try harder. I never could learn my \"outside edges\" - gliding in a circle to the left, say, with my weight on the outside edge of the left foot. Since that was preliminary to most of the ﬁgures, I didn't get very far.",

The staff used exactly the same methods on adults as on children - no scolding or urging, just instant reinforcement for each accomplishment; and there was plenty of accomplishment. Every\n\nsingle thing a skater needs to know was broken down into easily managed shaping steps, starting with falling down and getting up again. Gliding on one foot? Easy: Shove off from the wall, feet parallel, gliding on two feet; lift one up, ever so brieﬂy, put it down, then lift the other; then do it again, lift a little longer, and so on. In ten minutes the entire beginners' class, including the weak, the wobbly, the very young, and the very old, were gliding on one foot with looks of wild astonishment and elation on their faces.\n\nI didn't even realize that the \"crossover\" step they'd shaped in my second\n\nlesson had cured my childhood balance problems, until I found myself, during the free-skating period after class, sailing around corners blithely on my outside edges.

General business practice seems to decree that each side try to get as much as possible from the other while giving as little as possible. Of course this is really dumb from a training standpoint, and some managements lean toward other approaches. In the 1960s \"sensitivity training\" and other social-psychology approaches were popular, to enlighten management about the needs and feelings of coworkers and employees. One can be as enlightened as possible, however, and still not know what to do about an employee problem. The facts of business are that some people have more status and some less, some take orders and some give them. In our country a working situation is, for the most part, not like a family, nor should it be. Family-type interpersonal problem solving is therefore inappropriate.\n\nI was interested recently to see, cropping up here and there in business\n\nnews and publications, a more trainerly approach - ways to use reinforcement that range from the ingenious to the downright brilliant. For example, one management consultant suggests that when part of a group must be laid off, you identify the bottom 10 percent and the top 20 percent. You lay off the poorest performers, but you also make sure to tell the top 20 percent that they are being retained because they're doing such a good job. What a sensible idea. Besides saving your best people some sleepless nights and reinforcing them quite powerfully under the worrisome circumstances, you may be motivating intermediate performers either to seek the reinforcer they can now see is available or to avoid falling into the lowest percentile themselves.",

Cash bonuses for nonsmokers and for quitting smoking are paid by one\n\ncomputer-software company, and for good reason: The products it makes can be damaged by smoke particles. Other reinforcers in widening use include free choice of working hours, the \"ﬂextime\" system (especially desirable for working mothers), working in self-managed production teams, and being rewarded for getting the job done rather than for putting in the hours. All of these management techniques are designed around what the worker actually ﬁnds reinforcing - what works for people, not just for proﬁts.\n\nPrograms aimed at cost cutting and work speedups - programs that essentially try to force workers to do not quite as bad a job as they are presently doing - are not nearly as effective as programs that help workers to do a better job and then reward them for it. Corporations that use positive reinforcement often see the results on their bottom line. One example is Delta Airlines, which is known for taking very good care of its employees. During the 1981 recession, in spite of operating losses, Delta refused to lay off any of its 37,000 employees. In fact, it gave a companywide 8 percent pay raise. In a long-established climate of positive reinforcement, the employees thought in the same terms; they turned around and reinforced the company by pooling funds and buying it a new airplane, a $30-million Boeing 767.",

Training with reinforcement has opened up areas of discovery that I believe we've only begun to explore.\n\nOne of the advantages of reinforcement training is that you don't have to think up something for the animal to do and then train it to do that; you can reinforce anything the animal happens to offer and see where it leads. No one dreamed that harbor seals could \"talk,\" but at the New England Aquarium graduate student Betsy Constantine noticed that a rescued harbor seal named Hoover could make humanlike sounds. She shaped Hoover's sounds with ﬁsh reinforcers. Soon Hoover was \"saying\" a number of things.\n\nHoover (in a guttural bass voice but very distinctly): \"Hiya, honey, h'are\n\nIt's funny to hear, but also of real scientiﬁc interest to mammalogists and\n\nreinforcement training is the window that the training opens up into an animal's mind. It's been fashionable for decades to deny that animals have minds or feelings, and this was probably healthy - it cleared up a lot of superstitions, over-interpretation (\"My dog understands every word I say\"), and misreading. But then along came the ethologists, spearheaded by Konrad Lorenz, to point out that animals have internal states - anger, fear, and so on - and that these are signaled by very clear-cut postures, expressions, and movements, which can be recognized and interpreted.",

Very often the animal begins directing the resulting social behavior at the trainer - in signals ranging from greeting behavior to temper tantrums. Knowing nothing about a particular species but knowing how any subject tends to react to various training events, one can learn more about the nature of a species' social signals in a half hour of training than in a month of watching the animal interact with its own kind. For example, if I see a dolphin jump up in the air and come down with a big splash in a pool of other dolphins, I can only speculate as to why it did that; but if, in a training session, I fail to reinforce something I had previously reinforced every time, and the dolphin jumps up in the air and comes down with a big, directed splash that soaks me from head to toe, I can say with some certainty that at least part of the time it would seem likely that jump-splashes are aggressive displays, and effective ones, too.\n\nOne can tell more than that.

The polar bears turned out to be immensely persistent and dogged.

Shanti made noise with the Frisbee by holding it in her trunk and banging it on the wall, by rattling it along the bars like a child with a stick, and by putting it on the ﬂoor and shufﬂing it back and forth with her foot.

This is, of course, not so. Behavior is a rich soup of external and internal responses, learned and unlearned. Individuality is inborn, as every mother knows. (The biologist T. C. Schneirla demonstrated individual behavior even in insects.) Furtherance, a tremendous amount of what we do and feel is a product of our evolution as social animals. This includes our tendencies to cooperate and be good to each other (\"reciprocal altruism\") as well as our tendencies to react\n\naggressively if someone tromps on our ideas or property (\"territoriality\"). And then what one does or says at a given moment may depend just as much on one's physical state as on past experience or future expectations. A person who is extremely hungry or has a bad cold may behave quite differently from the same person when comfortable, regardless of what else is going on.\n\nSo reinforcement has limitations, and I see nothing wrong with that. I envision our understanding of behavior as resembling three interlocking rings. In one ring are the behaviorists such as Skinner and everything we know about learning and the acquisition of behavior; in another ring are the ethologists such as Lorenz and everything we know about the biological evolution of behavior; and in the third ring is behavior we don't yet understand well, such as play.

A psychologist friend has described to me a token reinforcement system with juvenile offenders in detention that worked wonderfully in a pilot project but fell apart completely, even producing dissension and rebellion, when established at another institution. It turned out the people in charge were distributing reinforcers as instructed for classroom attendance and other desirable behavior, but they didn't smile when they handed out the tokens. And with that small lapse, which was regarded (and rightly, I think) as an insult by the macho young offenders, the whole effort crumbled.\n\nReinforcement has been used on an individual and group basis to foster\n\nnot just speciﬁc behavior but characteristics of value to society - say, a sense of responsibility. Characteristics usually considered to be \"innate\" can also be shaped. You can, for example, reinforce creativity. My son Michael, while going to art school and living in a loft in Manhattan, acquired a kitten off the streets and reinforced it for \"cuteness,\" for anything it did that amused him. I don't know how the cat deﬁned that, but it became a most unusual cat - bold, attentive, loyal, and full of delightful surprises well into",

At Sea Life Park we shaped creativity with two dolphins - in an experiment that has now been much anthologized - by reinforcing anything the animals did that was novel and had not been reinforced before. Soon the subjects caught on and began \"inventing\" often quite amusing behaviors. One came up with wackier stuff than the other; on the whole, even in animals, degrees of creativity or imaginativeness can vary from one individual to another. But training \"shifts\" the curve for everyone, so that anyone can increase creativity from whatever baseline he or she began at.\n\nSociety, especially in the school system, is sometimes criticized for dampening creativity rather than encouraging it. I think that while such criticism is warranted, it's understandable that society would prefer the status quo. Once those dolphins learned the value of innovating, they became real nuisances, opening gates, stealing props, and inventing mischief. Innovative people are unpredictable by deﬁnition, and perhaps society can stand only a certain percentage of these types. If everybody behaved like our creative dolphins, we'd never get anything done. So, very often, individual creativity is discouraged in favor of group norms. Perhaps the courage it takes to defy that trend beneﬁts the innovators who do succeed.\n\nI think the important impact of reinforcement theory on our society will",

Reinforcement is information - it's information about what you are doing that is working. If we have information about how to get the environment to reinforce us, then we control our environment; we are no longer at its mercy. Indeed, our evolutionary ﬁtness to some extent depends on such success.\n\nSo subjects like to learn through reinforcement not for the obvious reason - to get food or other rewards - but because they actually get some control over what is happening. And the reason people like to modify the behavior of others through reinforcement is that the response is so gratifying. Seeing animals brighten up, little kids' eyes shine, people bloom and glow with accomplishment you have helped them achieve, is in itself an extremely powerful reinforcer. One gets absolutely hooked on the experience of getting good results.\n\nA curious but important corollary to training by reinforcement is that it breeds affection in both subject and trainer. When I was at Sea Life Park, it happened several times that an untamed dolphin, having been shaped with a marker signal, the whistle, and food reinforcers, suddenly became quite docile, allowed itself to be petted, and solicited social attention without any effort by us to \"hand-tame\" it or train it to do so. I have seen this happen with horses, too, sometimes in a single training session, and even with several species of zoo animals that were in no way gentled or made pets of. The animals behave as if they love the trainer.",

I remember Shanti the\n\nelephant and that wolf, D'Artagnan, with respect, and I even have a soft spot for that dunderheaded polar bear. What happens, I believe, is that the success of the training interchange tends to turn the participants into generalized conditioned reinforcers for each other. The trainer is the source of interesting, exciting, rewarding, life-enhancing events for the subject, and the subject's responses are interesting and rewarding for the trainer, so that they really do become attached. Not dependent, just attached. Comrades in the battle of life.\n\nOn the level of human interaction, good use of positive reinforcement\n\ncan have profound effects. It develops and intensiﬁes family feelings, cements friendships, gives children courage, and teaches them to be imaginative and skilled reinforcers in turn. It makes for great sex, for sex, after all, is in part a mutual exchange of positive reinforcers. If two people get really good at reinforcing each other, they are likely to be a happy pair.\n\nGood use of reinforcement does not mean just scattering rewards around indiscriminately or never saying no. People do fall into that misconception. Once, watching a mother pushing a toddler in a stroller down the street, I noticed that every time the baby began to fret, the mother stopped, got out a little bag of healthful snacks - raisins and nuts - and fed the child, although the child did not appear particularly hungry and sometimes pushed her hand away. Trying to do the right thing, she was conscientiously offering reinforcers to the child for fussing. She was also failing to check for rumpled clothes or other discomforts that might have been making the baby fuss in the ﬁrst place.",

I am suggesting that a shift to using positive responses in interactions with others, instead of the harshness, argumentativeness, and withdrawal that are the style in many households and organizations, affects not only the individuals involved but, rippling outward, their whole portion of society.\n\nIt seems to me that American society is, for all its freedom, a punitive society. We carry a burden of Calvinistic negativeness that colors all our institutions and much of our judgment, no matter what our personal backgrounds. A switch to positive reinforcement can be a startling event. In 1981 a little town in Arizona, desperate to hang on to its good schoolteachers, set up a foundation, raised money locally, and gave cash bonuses to ﬁve teachers, selected by faculty and community vote, amounting in some cases to a month's salary. The money was presented at high school graduation, and the teachers got a spontaneous standing ovation from the students, too. By the third year of operation the program seemed to be beneﬁting students as well as teachers. A typical mixed bag of races, ethnic backgrounds, and rich and poor, the students were by then ranking well above average on national testings.\n\nWhat I sense as signiﬁcant in this story is not the method of reinforcing\n\nthe top teachers, a good idea in itself, but the fact that the event made the wire services and was national news. Switching to positive reinforcement is at this moment in our culture a novel idea. But then, quickly becoming an acceptable idea, it is less often being dismissed as experimental or crackpot.",

Most behaviorists would, I expect, agree with me, wondering only why it's taking so long.\n\nPerhaps what the humanists object to most in behaviorism is the\n\nimplication that everything in society could and should be run by intent (as much of it is already - but badly run).

Idealistic societies, in imagination or in practice, sometimes fail to take into\n\naccount or seek to eliminate such biological facts as status conﬂict. We are social animals, after all, and as such we must establish dominance hierarchies. Competition within groups for increased status - in all channels, not just approved or ordained channels - is absolutely inevitable and in fact performs an important social function: Whether in Utopias or herds of horses, the existence of a fully worked-out hierarchy operates to reduce conﬂict. You know where you stand, so you don't have to keep growling to prove it.

(\"She only invited me to her party so I'd bring a present; I hate her.\" \"Aunt Tilly's being extraordinarily nice today; wonder what the old bat wants this time.\") I'm also not sure that our being tough on countries that misbehave is any better. What if they don't care? What if they wanted to get us mad in the ﬁrst place?\n\nI realize this may be simplistic, but I also think it is simple-minded to go on and on behaving as a nation in ways that any clicker trainer can tell you are guaranteed not to work. As a nation, as well as on an individual level, we ought to be continuously asking ourselves the trainer's fundamental question: What am I actually reinforcing?\n\nThe laws of reinforcement are powerful tools. But the rule book is far more versatile than some people have supposed, in fact more versatile than some people would like it to be. To be using reinforcement is to be involved in a process of continual change, of continual give-and-take, of continual growth. One becomes aware of the dualistic, two-way nature of this communion. One becomes more aware of others and, inevitably, more aware of oneself. It could be said that training is a process that requires one to be both inside and outside of one's own skin at the same time. Who is the trainer and who is the trained?

Living creatures have a right not only to food and shelter but to a reinforcing environment. The use and understanding of reinforcement is an individual experience, which may lead to beneﬁts for all. Far from being constricting, it frees each one of us to experience, be aware of, and enhance not the mechanistic aspects of living but the rich and wonderful diversity of all behavior.\n\nWhen Don't Shoot the Dog! was ﬁrst published in 1984, applied behavior analysis was still not in general use. Thirty years of dolphin training had not led to other applications. The academic community, while successfully using behavior analysis in corporate and institutional settings, had not come up with easily understood ways for untrained people to use their science.

This was followed a few days later by a \"Don't Shoot the Dog!\" seminar for 250 dog trainers that I conducted along with dog trainer Gary Wilkes and marine mammal trainer Ingrid Shallenberger. The little plastic clickers Gary had located in a novelty shop made great teaching tools as well as marker signals. People took to them. One dog-training seminar led to others. These public\n\nseminars, and the books, videos, and Internet activities they spawned, were, I believe, the start of the clicker-training movement.\n\nThe people in the seminar audiences were not necessarily professional trainers, though they might be keen hobbyists. They were attorneys, pilots, law enforcement ofﬁcers, teachers, computer programmers, business executives, dentists, doctors, and journalists. They were people with lively interests, lots of energy, and an analytical turn of mind. They began teaching others.

Any creature - a dog, a horse, a polar bear, even a ﬁsh - that you shape with positive reinforcers and a marker signal becomes playful, intelligent, curious, and interested in you.

One of the most common reactions, when conventional dog trainers switch over to clicker training, is their astonishment at how incredibly well the dogs retain what they've learned. You don't have to keep retraining the behavior and polishing it and brushing it up, the way you do with correction-trained behaviors. Put in the behavior, and it's there forever. I suspect (though no formal data that I know of yet prove it) that this high rate of retention might be one of the fundamental differences not only between training with positive reinforcers and aversives but between training with a marker signal, and training with just primary reinforcers.\n\nHere's one of my favorite examples of long-term retention from a single\n\ntraining episode. [From Karen Pryor on Behavior: Essays and Research (Sunshine Books, 1995).] One night after dinner, to amuse my cousins' children, I taught their cat to play the piano. With the word good as a marker signal and bits of ham as the primary reinforcer, I shaped the behavior of the cat sitting on the piano bench and plunking at the keys with one paw.

Another dog owner taught her Australian cattle dog all the Utility hand signals for down, come, sit, and so on, in three minutes, by the clock. Another woman passed the three qualifying legs of the Novice competition, with very nice scores, with a ten-year-old Irish setter she'd trained for only three weeks.

I'm hoping some graduate student will make use of the competitive obedience community's rich database to scientiﬁcally compare conventional methods and the new technology.\n\nA frequent and understandable objection to the idea of clicker training is\n\nthat you wouldn't want to be stuck having to click and treat for the rest of your subject's natural life. This, of course, is a misconception. The click is not intrinsic to maintaining the behavior; any old cue and any kind of reinforcer can do that. The click is for the training only. Once the learner has learned what you set out to teach it, you can put the clicker away. But you might use it again if you need to \"explain\" some new thing; you can communicate quite speciﬁc information with your clicker.\n\nFor example, my friend Patricia Brewington owns a clicker-trained Percheron gelding named James. Pat and her husband Daucy trained James with the clicker from babyhood through all his mature tasks of carrying riders, pulling wagons and sleighs, and hauling logs out of the woods. When James was fully educated, the clicker and food treats were no longer needed. James knew and complied with many voice cues and hand signals. He visibly enjoyed praise and patting as reinforcers for work well done; and also ice cubes, playing with balls, ringing his sleigh-bells with his nose, coming into the barn, going out of the barn, being allowed to watch whatever the people were doing, and many other daily-life reinforcers.",

So Pat got a bucket of warm water, set it next to James, and put his foot into the bucket. James took it out. Pat put it in. James took it out. Now James is a very large horse, and Pat is a small woman. Physical force was not an option; and Pat almost never scolds her horses. What to do? She went in the house and found a clicker. She\n\ncame back out to the barn. She put James's foot in the bucket - and clicked. Pat described his response metaphorically, as reinforcement trainers often do: \"Ohhh! You mean keep my foot in the bucket. Oh, okay.\" No carrot was needed to seal the bargain; James just hadn't understood what was wanted, and when he did understand, he didn't mind doing it.\n\nDuring my dolphin-training days I published a paper called \"The\n\nCreative Porpoise: Training for Novel Behavior,\" describing some work we had done at Sea Life Park.

Once again it wasn't entirely clear to me whether the capacity for inventing new behavior was special to dolphins or due to the training system.

She clearly knew that a click meant a handful of grain. She clearly knew her actions made her trainer click. And she knew it had something to do with her ears. But what? Holding her head erect, she rotated her ears individually: one forward, one back; then the reverse; then she ﬂopped both ears to the sides like a rabbit, something I didn't know a horse could do on purpose. Finally, both ears went forward at once. Click! Aha! She had it straight from then on.

For example, you might put a cardboard box on the ﬂoor and click the dog for snifﬁng it and then for bumping it with his nose, until he's pushing it around the room. The next time, you might let the dog discover that pushing the box no longer gets clicked but that pawing it or stepping over the side and eventually getting into the box is what works. The dog might also come up with dragging the box, or lifting and carrying the box. One dog, faced anew with the challenge of the box game, got all his toys and put them into the box. Click!

Conventional wisdom - and some psychologists - still hold that you should praise the good and punish the bad, and the result will be some kind of perfection in the middle. In fact, many of the problems people have in conventional training arise directly from the use of punishment. That Arabian mare had become unshowable because of a conventional method used for making a horse prick its ears: You swish a whip around its head (and hit it with the whip, now and then, back in the barn, so it knows the whip is dangerous). This mare had taken to laying her ears back and looking ugly instead of alert, a behavior that intensiﬁed with more punishment. Thus the remedial clicker training.\n\nDuring training sessions, clicker trainers are ﬁnding if they mix reinforcement of desirable behavior with punishment or correction of behavior that they don't want, good things stop happening. First, the accelerated learning stops, as the subject goes back to learning at the \"normal\" rate: slowly. Second, if they're not careful, the subject stops\n\nlearning altogether - and stops wanting to learn, which is worse. As a child might drag himself unwillingly to school, dawdling along the way, dogs can show reluctance to perform, and stress when in the training situation.

Of course, you might\n\nreprimand a dog for eyeing the hors d'oeuvres on the coffee table, or restrain it with a leash on a crowded sidewalk.

During a training session the animal is free to take a chance, to make a guess, to try to come up on its own with reinforceable behavior. If it guesses wrong, ﬁne. The worst that can happen is no click. In this safe arena learners quickly discover ways to show you the very best they are capable of, and that leads to wonderful results.\n\nHere's another side effect of clicker training that people report over and\n\nover again: the global behavior of the learner changes. A punished or correction-trained animal learns to give the minimum necessary in order to stay out of trouble. These learners are \"good soldiers\": They do what they're told, and they never volunteer. Under this regimen, even if obedient, learners remain far more interested in their own doings and private life than in whatever you or any voice of authority might want. They are therefore not only vulnerable to distractions, they are hoping for distractions. Furthermore, when pushed too hard or punished too much, these learners get mad or quit.

I've seen a profoundly low-functioning teenager laugh when she ﬁrst got a click for a new behavior, and sign \"play\" when she saw the clicker, a sign her teacher didn't know she knew. Clicker trainers have learned to recognize play behavior in animals as a sign that the learner has become consciously aware of what behavior was being\n\nreinforced. When \"the light bulb goes on,\" as clicker trainers put it, dogs gambol and bark, horses prance and toss their heads, and elephants, I am told, run around in circles chirping. They are happy. They are excited. That's reinforcing in itself. This event is predictable and replicable, and it is almost certainly accompanied by physiological changes, another fertile area for research.\n\nWhen an animal participates at this level, the click acquires enormous value. It is worth, much more than the food. Both the sound and the object that produces it become reinforcing. Here's an example. Debbie Davis is a clicker-training instructor who teaches disabled people to train their own service dogs. She herself is wheelchair-bound, and her service dog is a papillon, a little black and white toy breed about the size of a cat. The dog is very useful, in spite of his size. He can retrieve pencils, ﬁnd the TV remote, and pull laundry out of the dryer. When he and Debbie go to training class, this little dog gets down off her lap, goes around under the chairs, gets into people's training equipment bags, and steals clickers: \"Here, Mom - can't have too many of these, can we!\"",

For example, when turning to look at the instruments, you should take your hands off the airplane's controls to prevent accidentally turning the plane. However, as car drivers we've all learned to never take our hands off the wheel. Untraining a learned behavior is always much more tiresome than training a new one. A verbal reminder or correction takes far too long and comes too late. A click, however, can mark the smallest lift of the hands and pin it down forever.\n\nA ﬂight instructor can also click a student for initiative and for good thinking: for example, for glancing over the instrument panel before being reminded to do so. So the clicker can reward nonverbal behavior nonverbally in the instant it's occurring.

That little glitch in his training might have made a nightmare out of everything in his future career, from algebra to jotting down a girl's phone number. So ﬁx it now.\n\nThat of course is just a tiny sample of this educational application of operant conditioning. The Morningside Model is spreading. Dr. Johnson and his partner, T.Y Joe Layng, Ph.D., are also running a much larger program in the Chicago school system, and there are other related programs elsewhere.\n\nThe transformation of school systems so that they actually work will be,",

You cannot just hire an expert and say \"Fix my dog,\" or \"Fix my child,\" or even, \"Fix the school system.\" You are the primary trainer. This is a participation sport.\n\nI believe the general public's attitude about this branch of science has changed considerably in the last ﬁfteen years. There are still people who shudder at the very name of Skinner, which conjures in their minds some\n\namalgam of Brave New World, mind control, and electric shock. But for every one of those there are many more people who are comfortable with the concept of positive reinforcement.\n\nSome just give it lip service, of course. As Kathleen Weaver, the founder of the Internet Clicker List, points out, we trainers mean much more by the term clicker training than mere clicker-using. Clicker \"users,\" who may call themselves \"positive\" or \"motivational\" trainers, might borrow that particular device, the clicker, to mark their choice of speciﬁc behaviors. But then they go on using punishment, physical coercion, and all the other aversive tools of conventional training as well.",

    "page_content": "Clicker trainers, by contrast, may use any sort of stimulus as a marker signal; they attach no superstitious magic to the clicker itself. But they also consciously avoid superstitious behavior (such as escalation of punishment). And their toolkit consists of the full panoply of shaping, positive reinforcement, and related operant conditioning laws. They are the ones, whether working with children or adults, or horses or dogs, or any other animal, who reap the beneﬁts - rapid learning, long retention, happy, participating learners, and pure fun - of the technology we call clicker training.\n\nPerhaps the multitudinous minds working on the new technology will come up with a more distinguished and generic name for this approach than clicker training; I hope so. But that ultimate identiﬁer might not be in English. Thanks to the Internet, clicker training has become a planetary phenomenon. The Clicker List might hear one day from sled-dog trainers in Finland who use reindeer bone whistles (metal ones freeze to your lips) to click their dogs, and the next day from a poodle owner in Bosnia or a veterinarian in Singapore. Or an Englishwoman writes of teaching her pet hedgehog to fetch. In 1998 my website, www.dontshootthedog.com, was receiving 150,000 \"hits\" a month, from at least forty different nations monthly.\n\nThere is a buzz, a feeling of excitement, in all this shared\n\ncommunication, experimentation, and discovery. The early days of development of any technology must have been much the same: the early days of ﬂying, or of radio, when kids in remote farms tuned in on crystal",

We don't know where we will end up yet.\n\nAaron Lynch, author of Thought Contagion, quotes from communication engineering science on the special communication involved in the spread of a technology. For a technology to spread fast, he says, it has to have three characteristics: It must be easy; it must have visible beneﬁts to the user; and it must be something that can be learned in small increments. Clicker training ﬁts the bill. That's certainly what happened for the dog owners. When people see a conventionally trained dog in action, they tend to say, \"That must have taken years, I could never do that.\" Or, \"My dog could never be that smart.\" In contrast, people see a clicker-trained dog in action and exclaim: \"How did you do that? Can I do it? Show me. Let me try.\"\n\nYou can't tell, in advance, what particular event will be the hook for each\n\nnew group of users. Alexandra Kurland's horses and clients, working in a big boarding stables with dozens of other people around every day, were learning all kinds of new skills and at tremendous rates; but it was all dismissed by the onlookers as \"that crazy clicker stuff\" - until she taught a horse to retrieve. To fetch a toy, like a dog. Suddenly everyone in the stables had to have a retrieving horse. \"How'd you do that? Can I do it too?\"\n\nIn a recent e-mail Alex wrote, \"It's done. We can't put the genie back in\n\nI hope she's right about the genie and the bottle.\n\nI know she's right about the fun. It has always been fun.",
